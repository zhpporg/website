our son's birthdate qualified him for kindergarten, he needed more time
to build skills, confidence, and socialization. Enter ZHPP! We enrolled
him in the 5's class and it was the best decision we could have made.
Our son is now a thriving first grader. ZHPP is an amazing community,
devoted to each and every child.

 can't express how happy we have been with the Zion's Hill Preschool
Program 5's class. Our youngest has a late fall birthday and we knew we
wanted to give him that extra time before entering Kindergarten. Zion's
Hill has been exactly what he needed.</p>

<p>The class ratio of two full-time amazing teachers for 12 children
allows each child to have individual attention.The teachers are able to
fully embrace the play-based learning philosophy of ZHPP while at the
same time really working with each child to help prepare him or her for
Kindergarten - working on reading, writing, and math skills.</p>

<p>He is gaining so much from the various learning centers, play time,
community building, and opportunities for developing independence and
responsibility that are critical to young children.Every day my son is
excited to go to school and at least once a week he tells me that he has
 the best teachers in the world. This will be his last preschool
experience and to have him this happy, growing and thriving academically
 and socially is all that a parent can ask for. He will remember his
time at ZHPP fondly and it is a year that my husband and I will treasure
 for him.</p>
