## From the Director’s Desk:

April showers bring May flowers. As Spring arrived, we were a little mystified by the snow, but it looks like we are finally turning the corner. March was filled with activities that helped the children have fun on those days where we just could not get outside. I spent some extra time in the classrooms doing special activities with each age group. It was so nice to go back to my teaching roots for a little while. Fruit sushi, ice cream in a bag, rainbows in a jar, Irish Soda bread, fizzing green eggs, and salt dough dinosaur bones – oh what fun! Ask your child which activity they got to be a part of last month.

This month is going to be overflowing with activities and events for all to enjoy. We will begin with yoga to help us ease into the month of excitement, then all will enjoy a much needed Spring Break. I hope your families get to do some fun and exciting activities together. Upon our return, we will have some Music with Miss Joanne and our annual Parents & Pastries event. This will be followed by a week of celebrating your children with the “Week of the Young Child”. It will be a week of fun and adventure for all the children including some parent involvement activities and finished off with the Playground clean up.

I hope you will be able to join some of the very special activities happening this month. After all, as Robin Williams said, “Spring is Nature’s way of saying, ‘Let’s Party!’ ”

From 10:00-11:00am, we welcome families to visit ZHPP and watch as their child’s creativity transforms them into a Little Artist. The activities will be geared towards “April Showers.” The children will hear the story, It Looked Like Spilt Milk, create puffy clouds and design rain sticks. This will be a small introduction to how Zion’s Hill Preschool uses simple skills and fun activities to allow children to explore the world around them.

## Extended Day Programs

### Afternoon Adventures

Did you know that your child can extend their learning until 3:00pm at Zion’s Hill Preschool? Themed Afternoon Adventures occur each day from 12:30-3:00pm for the 3′s, 4′s and 5′s. After a brief rest period to regroup, the children do a variety of activities and enjoy additional outdoor time on our beautiful playgrounds. Monday is filled with Games and Gadgets to engage the mind. Board games, outdoor games and the use of the smart board fill the afternoon. On Tuesday the children experience a second language as Señora Vicky teaches Spanish in small group sessions. On Wednesday the children have the opportunity to create structures with a variety of materials as they explore Building and Design. Cooking is a crowd pleaser on Thursday. The children get to develop their senses of taste and smell while creating and eating delicious treats. And what better way to finish a week than with a little Fitness Fun on Friday?

If you would like your child(ren) to participate in these amazing adventures, drop-in availability is limited so please sign up 24 hours in advance. Payment of $40 per session is due upon sign-up.

We look forward to extending your child’s learning through more fun and exciting activities. This is a great opportunity for children in the 4′s and 5′s programs to begin transitioning to a longer day. Kindergarten is a big adjustment so helping them get a jump start is always beneficial.
