## From the Director’s Desk:

November has been another busy month and Mother Nature has given us such beautiful weather to enjoy.  Our horse drawn hay rides were a huge success on a fantastic fall day.  The children admired the draft horses and had fun singing “Old MacDonald Had a Farm” as we rode through the school and church lots.  All the children enjoyed another round of yoga, music, Spanish and library this month.  Spanish was highlighted with learning some words related to Thanksgiving and stories about turkeys from Miss Andrea during library time.

The end of the month was extra special as our 4′s and 5′s classes hosted a Thanksgiving Feast for their families.  The smells of them cooking filled the air throughout the week and their table decorations were extra special.  It was wonderful to see all the smiles on the faces as the children sang, “Simple Gifts.”

Our food drive was a huge success with all classrooms participating.  The food will be delivered to local food banks to help assist local families through the holiday season.

December will be a shortened month, however, we will be as busy as ever.  The children will be learning about all of the holidays and we invite parents to share the many holiday traditions your families celebrate.  The school will come together on December 16th for the annual Holiday Sing-Along.

Will we be dashing through the snow?  No one knows, but we will enjoy all the joys of the season throughout the month.

## Important Notes

### Parent Teacher Conferences

Parent Teacher conferences are still occurring.  If you were unable to make your original time, please check with your child’s teacher for a time that would be convenient to reschedule.

### Breakfast Club – New Option

Starting this month, we will offer two different drop off times for Breakfast Club, 8:00 or 8:30 am daily.  The fee is $12 for the hour and $7 for 30 minutes and includes a light breakfast of cereal and fruit.  We require a 24-hour registration notification to schedule staff accordingly.  Additionally, if you need to cancel, 24 hours’ notice is requested.

### School Pictures

Please return the pictures you do not wish to keep along with your payment to the office by Monday, December 5th. We expect revised class photos to arrive prior to this day. Sorry for any inconvenience this may have caused.

### Changing Weather

Please remember to dress your child appropriately with the change of seasons and upcoming winter weather. We go outside every day and the children need the appropriate clothing according to the weather forecast and conditions outside. Try to send in clothing that your child can independently manage.  Please also remember to update your child’s spare clothing with appropriate change of clothing in case it is needed. Layers always work well.

### School Closings, Delays, and Dismissals

Please remember that we follow the Wilton Public School schedule for weather related closings, delays and early dismissals.  If there is a delayed opening, ZHPP will begin at 10:30 AM.  If there is an early dismissal, ZHPP will dismiss at 12:30 PM, with no afternoon programs.  We will advise of any weather related schedule changes via text message and email.
