## From the Director’s Desk:

We are already a month into the year and there is so much to reflect upon. February is a month to think about kindness, friendships and the people, places and things we love.

First off, I know all the teachers and students are loving this mild winter and the opportunity to get out and enjoy our wonderful surroundings on most days, and when we are inside the use of the movement room and library are a welcomed change of scenery for the children. Many children got to enjoy their ZHPP friendships at Tumble Jungle during one of the school holidays. Watching the children show their care and concern for each other daily is an amazing experience. Whether a friend is absent, hurt or sad, they always help each other out. They also compliment the accomplishments and successes of their peers regularly.

The love for the arts and literacy continued last month with yoga, music and library, of course.

February will be filled with many more opportunities to express those loving feelings. We will enjoy African Drumming provided by Enchanted Garden, the dentist will visit to teach us how to care for our teeth properly, and in early March we will show our love for reading as we celebrate Read Across America Day.

Additionally, many of the children learned about Random Acts of Kindness over the past few months. We will continue this study with an interactive bulletin board this month. It will be titled “Share the Love – Do a RAOK.” Parents and children can complete one of the acts, take a picture and then display it on the board for everyone to see. I did this with my own children in December and it was amazing. The best was the one that landed on the Ridgefield Facebook page and was being paid forward. One small act can go a very long way.

I am looking forward to enjoying another lovely month with you and your children.

## Board of Directors Update

### Join the ZHPP Board!

The board is a group of parent volunteers who want to share their talents and give back to the school that has given our children and families so much. We meet monthly to plan programs and activities for the school, set policies, address suggestions made by parents and staff, review the budget and ensure delivery of our mission statement.

As families graduate from Zion’s Hill, openings on the board become available. We are looking for people who are interested in serving for the 2017-2018 school year and invite you to join us!

Please contact Jessica Joy (jandpjoy9@msn.com), Jen Longmire (jlongmire1@optonline.net) or Heather Bravi (heather.bravi@gmail.com) for more information regarding the board or to request an application.

## Important Notes

### Breakfast Club – New Option

We now offer two different drop off times for Breakfast Club, 8:00 or 8:30am daily. The fee is $12 for the hour and $7 for 30 minutes and includes a light breakfast of cereal and fruit. We require a 24-hour registration notification to schedule staff accordingly. Additionally, if you need to cancel, 24 hours’ notice is requested.

### Sick Children

Please do not bring sick children into the school. We work very hard to keep a healthy school environment. We can assist you in monitoring your car visually or pickup or deliver your child to his or her classroom. Call the office when your child is staying home sick so we can make the other classroom families aware if necessary.

### Changing Weather

Please remember to dress your child appropriately for the winter weather. We go outside every day and the children need clothing according to the weather forecast and conditions outside. Try to send in clothing that your child can independently manage. Layers always work well.

### School Closings, Delays, and Dismissals

Please remember that we follow the Wilton Public School schedule for weather-related closings, delays, and early dismissals. If there is a delayed opening, ZHPP will begin at 10:30am. If there is an early dismissal, ZHPP will dismiss at 12:30pm, with no afternoon programs. We will advise of any weather-related schedule changes via text message and email
