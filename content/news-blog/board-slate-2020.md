Every year around this time, the ZHPP Board of Directors accepts applications in order to build the slate for next year’s Board. This slate is then voted on at the Annual Meeting of Zion’s Hill Preschool Program, Inc., held in May.

This year’s Annual Meeting will be held via Zoom on Wednesday, May 6th at 7:30 pm, and all families are invited to attend. A Zoom invitation will be sent prior to the meeting time.

Below, please find the slate for the ZHPP Board of Directors for the 2020-2021 school year.
