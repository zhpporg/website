## From the Director’s Desk:

Dear Families,

May flowers are abundant around the school as many of the classrooms started planting and the perennials are beginning to pop up around the grounds. April was a short month but packed full of excitement as always.

The Week of the Young Child is one of the most rewarding parts of the year, when we come together as a community to celebrate the children. It is always a fun time to see the children in silly hats, enjoying pajama parties and show and tell. We love seeing the wonderful tie dye creations worn by all at the end of the week during the Children’s Parade and finished off with our lunchtime pizza party.

Our 4′s and 5′s got to visit the Beardsley Zoo while the other children spent extra time outside enjoying the beautiful weather at the end of the month.

Spring Parent Conferences will finish this month. It is so wonderful to hear about the progress that all of the children have made during the school year.

The playgrounds are looking fantastic after our spring clean-up. The sandboxes have been filled. More mulch is on the way. We have some beautiful weather ahead of us to enjoy.

It was a delight to see so many families at Spring Fling on April 20. The efforts of so many individuals made an evening full of community spirit, great food and fun. Thank you to all who made purchases to make this event a success as always.

May will be a month full of memories. The children will show the teachers how much they appreciate them from May 7-11. Physical activity will be encouraged with Bike Day and the Mini Marathon. The celebrations continue with our bi-annual Family Fun Day and Wilton’s Memorial Day Parade.

We are all looking forward to it all!

## Special Events

### Bike Day

May 16

Bike Day will be on Wednesday, May 16 for the 4′s and 5′s classes. Each child may bring his or her bike and helmet on this day. The teachers will take the children out during the day to ride around the parking lot on their own bikes. This is very exciting for the children to show off their bike riding skills.

### Family Fun Day!

Save the Date! Our Spring Family Fun Day will be held at the backyard of ZHPP on Sunday, May 20 from 10:30am-12:30pm.

### Mini Marathon

The Mini Marathon is a Zion’s Hill tradition that was started by a group of moms who enjoyed running. The event will take place on Friday, May 25 at 9:15am. Parents are invited to watch or run laps around the parking lot with the children while the staff members facilitate the race. There will be time keepers, a water station, start and finish lines and cheerleaders. The children will run 1 lap less than their age (2 year old – 1 lap, 5 year old – 4 laps). This is a fun event for all to partake in as a group. Spectators are welcome. If you are interested in running with your child’s class, please tell your child’s teacher.

### Memorial Day Parade

May 28

Any family wishing to participate in the Wilton Memorial Day parade with Zion’s Hill is welcome. Our group will walk the parade route together. The children march or ride in decorated wagons with their parents. Sign up information will be available soon.

### Graduation and End-of-Year Celebrations

June 14 and 15

Each classroom will have an end of the year celebration and picnic. Children in the 4′s and 5′s classes will put on a presentation for the parents. This will include some songs, presentation of certificates and the opportunity to cross over the bridge as a rite of passage. The younger classrooms will have picnics to celebrate the end of the school year and moving on to their next program. Each classroom will provide details as the events get closer.

## Important Notes

### Parent-Teacher Conferences

Parent-Teacher conferences are a great opportunity for you to hear about the progress of your child. The teachers will sit with you for 15 to 30 minutes to review your child’s daily routine and show you work that he or she has created. This will also allow you time to ask any questions that you may have regarding your child’s learning. The teachers look forward to sharing the growth that they have seen in each child and highly encourage all families to participate.

### Registration

Kindly return your 2018-2019 contract and first tuition payment to the office by Tuesday, May 15th.
