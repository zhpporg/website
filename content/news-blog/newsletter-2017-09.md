## From the Director’s Desk:

Dear Parents,

It is hard to believe, but summer has come to an end.  I am so excited and honored to be starting my second full school year at Zion’s Hill Preschool Program.  The summer at the school was very busy, as we redesigned some of the classroom spaces, incorporated new materials, and installed some cabinetry in our conference room.

The teachers are very excited to start using the new curriculum materials, including STEM materials. Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math are all part of everyday play, however the teachers will be doing more activities and experiments to engage the students in this type of learning process.

We encourage parents to spend time in the classrooms and volunteer when your schedule permits.  Zion’s Hill Preschool Program offers an array of opportunities for social gatherings, parent interactions and most importantly, creating long lasting relationships for the children and adults alike.

I am looking forward to working with you and your child this year. It is a joy to watch children learn and grow before my eyes. Their time of being little goes so quickly, and the dedicated staff at ZHPP cherishes the chance to help shape them through our play-based curriculum.

Cheers to a successful school year!

At 8:55, a staff member will escort the children to their regular classrooms.
