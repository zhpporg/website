## Happy Fall!

Dear Families,

The school year is in full swing, and such fun fall will bring! The children have settled in beautifully to their classrooms and routines, and the staff and I have loved getting to know each of them—and you too! It is so heartwarming to see friendships forming, and the halls and classrooms once again filled with the children’s artwork and proud evidence of their learning (just a glimpse of what you will hear about at Open House!). We also love seeing all of YOU spend time with one another, whether at the Fall Parent Social (thank you to the Haggertys for hosting!) or at ZHPP’s upcoming annual Fall Family Fun Day. This sense of community is precisely what makes our school so special!

October promises to be fun-filled and festive. Our monthly “specials” of music and yoga with ZHPP’s own Miss JoAnne, and Spanish with the always-entertaining Senora Vicky, will begin, and we will take advantage of the still-bright days to spend time in the Bike Park. We will also observe National Fire Safety Month with special visits from the Wilton Fire Department, the children will show off their pearly whites during Photo Days, and the Four’s and Five’s will take a field trip to Ambler Farm. Busy indeed … the Fall Break will be well-timed! We hope you enjoy fall family time too—whether it be apple picking, leaf peeking, pumpkin carving, or preparing your child’s perfect costume, we can’t wait to be “treated” to a parade and celebrate Halloween with your little ones!

Happy Fall,

Jessica

## Happenings

### Mommy and Me

Space is limited, but there is still time to register! Our seven-week Mommy and Me class begins Wednesday, October 2, after drop-off, and features Zion’s Hill’s FABULOUS music and yoga instructor, Miss JoAnne! The class is geared to future Two’s and will offer movement and music through songs, puppet play, poems, dramatics, freeze dance, and other activities to foster creative expression and exercise.

### Fall Family Fun Day

On Sunday, October 6, 10:30–12:30, bring the family to ZHPP to celebrate fall with games, crafts, face painting, a bounce house, and more. Enjoy music by Ramblin’ Dan’s Free Wheelin’ Band, hot dogs from Chez Lenard, ice cream, and awesome autumn treats like apple cider and cider donuts.

### Wilton Fire Department Visits

The Wilton Fire Department will be making special visits to Zion’s Hill on Thursday, October 10, and Wednesday, October 16. The children will meet the friendly firefighters, learn about their important jobs in helping keep us safe, and climb aboard the trucks for exploration.

### Open House

Please join us for our annual Open House on Thursday, October 17, at 7:30pm. We will begin the evening with light refreshments in the Zion’s Hill foyer, followed by a brief presentation in the Conference Room. Parents are then invited to visit their child’s classroom to meet with the teachers. Learn about the curriculum and the special activities and events planned for the school year. This is a great opportunity to get to know our dedicated staff and meet other parents. To that end, please note that Open House is for adults only. RSVP with your child’s teacher.

### After Open House
ZHPP parents are invited to Cactus Rose immediately following Open House on Thursday, October 17. Connect with fellow parents and enjoy the evening out!

### Cards for Miss Kristen

Our beloved Four’s teacher Miss Kristen has moved to PA. We would like to celebrate her by creating/writing cards. If you and/or your children are interested in contributing a card, please bring it to the collection box in the lobby by Friday, October 18. We will send them along with a nice ZHPP memento. (PS. Her birthday is also at the end of October, so the cards will be extra special tokens of our appreciation and gratitude!)

### Swap Meet

Save the afternoon of Saturday, October 19, for a ZHPP Swap Meet! How many of us have one or more of these: a pristine Patagonia your child outgrew, a doll cradle no one plays with, a board game that hasn’t been opened, a skateboard your child begged for and used twice? Let’s get together and trade our amazing goods for kids ages 2–6. Details will follow, but start setting aside up to 20 items and get excited to bring new goodies home!

## Fundraising

### Annual Appeal

Did you know that tuition does not cover the cost of the school’s daily operations? Instead, Zion’s Hill Preschool Program holds an Annual Appeal each fall in order to fund everything from rent and staff salaries to Enrichment Programming (e.g., Spanish, yoga and music, Masterpiece, Pied Piper, etc.). The Annual Appeal will kick off in October. Please be on the lookout for additional information in your mailbox. If you have any questions, feel free to contact our Fundraising Chairs Sarah Rhee, Michelle Haggerty, Kinley Welly, and Kelli McGee at fundraisingandevents@zhpp.org. We look forward to your participation and thank you in advance for your consideration!

### Fall Family Photos with Xenia Gross

Wilton photographer and former ZHPP mom, Xenia Gross, is donating her time and talent to benefit our preschool. Xenia is offering a 20-minute photo session and one high-resolution digital image of your choice in exchange for a $100 donation to ZHPP. This year she is offering an assortment of dates and locations to make it easier for families. There are still available openings:

Best of all, thanks to the generosity of one of our families, a cash donation match up to $500 will be made directly to Zion’s Hill. Look for the display for additional details and the collection mailbox in the foyer, and start clipping!

At 8:55, the children are escorted by staff to their regular classrooms.

## Reminders

### Changing Weather

Please remember to dress your child for the upcoming winter weather. We attempt to go outside every day and the children need the appropriate clothing to be comfortable in the conditions. Please try to send in clothing that your child can independently manage. Also, please remember to update your child’s spare clothing with a seasonally-appropriate set.

### Tuition Payments

ZHPP does not send invoices for tuition. Please remit your payment to the office on or before the due date.

### Pick-Ups
Please be sure to notify the office and your child’s teacher if someone other than you will be picking up your child. We will also check the driver’s license or another form of ID when alternative pick-up arrangements are made.

### Parking Lot Safety

Please use extreme caution when driving and walking in the parking lot—many little bodies are underfoot and can be difficult to see! Hold your child’s hand and watch for cars. We recommend entering through the lower driveway and exiting from the upper driveway during the busy drop-off and pick-up times.

### ZHPP Is an Allergy-Aware Environment

We ask that parents be aware of the foods that they send in children’s lunches. We do not allow peanut butter, nuts, or foods containing nuts. We will send home any products that state on the label that it comes from a plant that processes nuts. In addition, we send home food that looks like it contains nuts.
