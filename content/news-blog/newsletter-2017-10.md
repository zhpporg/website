## From the Director’s Desk:

Dear Parents,

The school year is off to a great start! The children have had a smooth transition into their new classrooms and for many, into their new school as well. The teachers are having so much fun getting to know each and every one of them through home visits and classroom interactions. I’ve been able to spend time in each of the classrooms and have enjoyed all the conversations with your little ones.

The days are flying by with all of our special activities in full swing. Thank you to Heather Gaudio for hosting the Parent Social at your gallery, Heather Gaudio Fine Art in New Canaan. It was also great to see so many of our families at the Fall Family Fun Day. Watching the children be pirates and mermaids was so much fun and they all enjoyed searching for sea shells, bobbing for donuts and decorating pumpkins. Miss Joanne was back to teach music and Miss Andrea from the Wilton Library paid us a visit. October will be full of more excitement when the Wilton Fire Department stops by with the fire truck, yoga begins, and everyone participates in our ever-so-popular Halloween Parades.

On top of all these activities, the Afternoon Adventures have been crowd pleasers, so be sure to sign-up as soon as possible to guarantee a spot. This week the children played some games on the SmartBoard on Monday and learned counting and songs in Spanish on Tuesday. Wednesday was fun as they explored the variety of buildings at the school and talked about the designs of each including materials used, shapes they could see and number of doors and windows. On Thursday, the crew cooked up some delicious fruit kabobs and on Friday, the children enjoyed both extra time in the movement room and the beautiful weather on the playground. The rock wall is definitely a workout for the children and the basketball game was super enjoyable (of course the children beat the teachers!).

I’m looking forward to everyone falling into the fun and festivities of this month!

## Featured Family: The Barrs

On October 28, ZHPP dad Gary Barr will be embarking on a 100-mile, 24-hour run from the Catskills to Ridgefield, CT, to raise awareness about stillbirth for his non-profit, Anchors For Hope. In 2014, Laura and Gary Barr were devastated when without warning and for no apparent reason, they lost their son Henry to stillbirth at 39 weeks gestation. Though it was a long road of grieving and eventually healing, they always knew they wanted to make a difference in others’ lives in Henry’s honor. On December 22, 2015, what would have been his first birthday, they founded Anchors For Hope with the mission to raise awareness about stillbirth and to support bereaved parents affected by both pregnancy and infant loss.Last year, Gary did his first run in Henry’s honor – he ran 222 miles from Washington DC to New York City in just 10 days. Of the run, Gary says “It was my way of doing something for Henry. I was able to process my grief and find healing through the many months of training, time spent alone to reflect, and raising awareness and funds to support our Hope & Healing Retreat ambitions. And the love and support we received from others was so encouraging and honestly kept me going.”

In addition to being hugely healing and a way to raise awareness, they also raised $15,000 for their charity. The money is being used primarily for the support side of their mission – to help fund retreats and workshops for bereaved parents. In August, Laura hosted the first ever Hope & Healing Retreat with the goal of helping bereaved moms who have lost babies to find their tribe, honor their child and heal a little bit of their heart. It was a huge success and two more are being planned for next year.

October is Pregnancy and Infant Loss Awareness Month. Each year in the U.S., 26,000 babies are lost to the devastation of stillbirth. To learn more about the Barr’s organization, donate, or get in touch, go to www.anchorsforhope.org.

## Important Notes

### Board of Directors

There are still a few spots remaining on the Board of Directors for the 2017-2018 academic year. We invite you to consider volunteering for a position and support the school that gives so much to our children. Please contact the Board Co-Chairs Melissa Leonard (mwalker521@gmail.com) or Heather Bravi (heather.bravi@gmail.com) with any questions.

### ZHPP Communications

Please be sure to check all of your email folders for mail from ZHPP.  You should be receiving emails from Tadpoles, Constant Contact and Evite that include important information about school events and news. We have learned that some of these emails are going to spam, trash and promotional categories instead of the inbox. If you are not receiving emails, please notify the office.

### Safety Reminder

We welcome the children to play outside after school and ask that you please use the playgrounds. Please do not allow children to run near the parking lot at pick-up.

### Additional Reminders

Please kindly park in one of the designated parking spots and not the bend of the parking lot unless all spaces are full. This makes it difficult for larger vehicles to make the turn.

When signing in, please indicate the first and last name of the person who will be picking up.

Pick up time is 12:30 pm for our core program and 3:00 pm for Afternoon Adventures and Extensions.

Please send a healthy lunch containing 2-3 items including one protein. It is a ZHPP practice to not serve candy during our lunch period.

### Afternoon Adventures and Extensions

Our extended day programs are offered on a drop-in or contract basis. If you are interested in contracting for either a semester or the full year, please stop by the office to complete a registration form. There is a 2.5% savings over the drop in rate for semester contracts and a 5% savings for a full year contract.

### Forms Due

If you have not done so already, please remember to turn in the following forms to the office: (1) signed acknowledgement page from the back of your handbook, (2) photo permission form and (3) discipline form. Thank you.
