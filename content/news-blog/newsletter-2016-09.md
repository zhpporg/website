It is hard to believe, but summer has come to an end. I am so excited and honored to be starting my first full school year at Zion’s Hill Preschool Program. The summer at the school was very busy, as we created some very special spaces for the children to enjoy.

With the addition of an active movement room and library with smart board, your children are sure to come home with even more special memories to share with you. Additionally, each morning as the teachers are preparing for the school day, there will be engaging activities in the lobby with Miss Brenda and myself. These activities will help ease the transition for the families. Having routines with children helps to ease their minds and give them a sense of comfort.

We encourage parents to spend time in the classrooms and volunteer when your schedule permits. Zion’s Hill Preschool Program offers an array of opportunities for social gatherings, parent interactions and most importantly, creating long lasting relationships for the children and adults alike.

I am looking forward to working with you and your child this year. It is a joy to watch children learn and grow before my eyes. Their time of being little goes so quickly, and the dedicated staff at ZHPP cherishes the chance to help shape them through our play-based curriculum.

Cheers to a successful school year!

Kelly

## Special Events

### Playground Clean Up Day

Thank you to all the families that came to help with the playground cleanup on August 27th. It was hot and everyone was sweaty but the job got done with even the youngest of helpers! Weeding, scrubbing toys, filling sand boxes were just a few of the jobs done to get the playgrounds looking perfect for the opening of school. Thank you for all of your hard work!

### Meet the Teacher and Ribbon Cutting Ceremony

Many thanks to all of the families that joined us for our Meet the Teacher event. We had a wonderful turnout! The teachers were so excited to meet the children and let them take a sneak peek into their new classrooms.

It was clear from the smiles and expressions of wonder and curiosity that our new library and movement room are going to be very well used and enjoyed.

We are so grateful to the families of Zion’s Hill, past and present that supported Spring Fling and made this incredible transformation possible. And many thanks to the staff for working so hard this summer to create these amazing spaces! A special shout out to Miss Brenda, Miss Louise and Miss Anne!

## Extended Day Programming

### Afternoon Adventures

Our wonderful extended day programs for the Three’s, Four’s and Five’s are designed so your child can learn, play and explore a new skill in a caring and nurturing environment. Afternoon Adventures include a short rest, focused instruction from our teachers, snack and playground time, and runs from 12:30 pm – 3:00 pm. Choose the day or days that appeal to your budding adventurer:

* Monday: Games and Gadgets
* Tuesday: Spanish Language
* Wednesday: Building and Design
* Thursday: Cooking with Friends
* Friday: Fun with Fitness

### Extensions for Two’s

Extended day options are available for our Two’s as well, with less emphasis on focused instruction but more time for rest and free play. Extensions also include snack and playground time, and run from 12:30 pm – 3:00 pm. Beginning this year, extensions will be offered Monday through Friday, starting September 19.

The staff/child ratios are the same in the afternoon as in the morning program. Space for these programs is limited so registration is required. All drop-in requests are subject to availability.

### Breakfast Club

This program allows parents to drop off their child at 8:00 am, before the start of our core program. All children in the Breakfast Club will meet in the same assigned classroom and enjoy quiet age appropriate activities and a healthy breakfast provided by the school. At 8:55, a staff member will escort the children to their regular classrooms.

### Calling All Volunteers

Being a room representative is one of many ways to help out in your child’s classroom while becoming involved in the school community. Specific duties include: acting as a liaison between teachers and families, finding volunteers for classroom special events and field trips, coordinating teacher gifts, and communicating important school-wide news to families. It is also a great way to get to know the other parents in the class! If you would like to be a room rep, or if you have questions about this position, please email Melissa Leonard, 2nd Vice Chair at mwalker521@gmail.com.

## Important Notes

### Driveway Construction

The upper driveway will be closed for construction September 14-16 (Wednesday-Friday).

### Tuition Payments

ZHPP does not send invoices for tuition. Please kindly remit your payment to the office on or before the due date.

### Pick-Ups

Please be sure to notify the office and your child’s teacher when someone other than you is picking up your child. Also, please remind that person to bring a driver’s license for identification.

### Parking Lot Safety

Please use extreme caution when driving and walking in the parking lot. Hold your child’s hand. Remind your friends and family when they pick up your child to use extra caution in the parking lot. We recommend driving in the lower driveway and out the upper driveway during the busy morning drop off.

### ZHPP is An Allergy-Aware Environment

We ask that parents be aware of the foods that they send in their children’s lunches. We do not allow peanut butter, nuts or foods containing nuts. We will send home any products that state on the label that it comes from a plant that processes nuts. In addition, we send home food that looks like it contains nuts.
