## Celebrations of Love!

Dear Parents,

Happy February! The slow start to winter, with many sunny days, has helped everyone adjust to the colder temps, and the SNOW!! Despite the work involved donning winter gear, it’s always worth it and great for the kids to get fresh air! They love it, and find the playgrounds provide an entirely different environment in which to explore and cooperatively discover.

Indoors, we are gallivanting along with our wonderfully planned schedules and routines, along with some extra fun. February is a month filled with “love”, and the perfect time to celebrate friendships and the people and things we care about most in our lives. We begin our month-long celebration of love with Parents and Pastries. This historically fun event will take place on Saturday, February 9 from 9:30 to 11am. The teachers are looking forward to seeing dads, grandparents, aunts/uncles (or whomever your child “loves”!!!), and for the children to proudly show off his/her classroom, creations, and “love” of learning. We will have special classroom celebrations for Valentine’s Day, and throughout the month the office staff will be leading lessons on kindness and empathy. It is always a highlight for us to visit and spend time in the classrooms and watching the children show their care for one another is truly heartwarming. Whether it be helping a friend locate a misplaced item, holding hands down the hallway, or greeting a classmate with a hug after he or she was out sick, we are tickled by their compassion. We invite you to help develop these important social-emotional skills by participating in our Community Outreach program. This month, we’ll be collecting valentines for residents of a local assisted-living facility. Finally, February will also bring a visit from Dr. Maksymiuk of MaxDental to celebrate National Dental Health Month and teach us how to brush properly for a “lovely” smile, and we round out the month with Read Across America Day to celebrate our “love” of reading.

We hope you, too, will take time to reflect on the people and things that bring love to your life. We are sincerely grateful to be able to spend time with your children and families each day. We love Zion’s Hill, and the special people (big and small) within its walls.

XOXO,  
Anne and Jessica

The Board is comprised of parent volunteers who share their talents and give back to the school that gives our children and families so much. We meet one evening a month to plan programs and activities for the school, set policies, address suggestions from parents and staff, review the budget and ensure the delivery of our mission statement.

As families graduate from ZHPP, openings on the Board become available. We are looking for people who are interested in serving for the 2019-2020 school year and invite you to join us!

Parent Workshop: Parenting is the Hardest Job in the World (What Works and What Doesn’t) by Susan O’Brien
Wednesday March 13 at 9:30am
ZHPP Conference Room

Please join us on March 13 at 9:30am in the conference room for a great parent workshop by Susan O’Brien.
“When our children push our buttons our skills go out the window and we may respond in ineffective ways. This workshop will teach strategies so you can discipline your child even when you are stressed. You will learn how to recognize when you are stressed and develop techniques to react appropriately in the face of your child pushing your buttons. You will learn how to manage every day parenting challenges by approaching these challenges in a calm and positive manner.”
Community Outreach

### Will You Be A Valentine?

During the month of February, we will be collecting valentines for residents at The Greens of Cannondale/Wilton Meadows. The Greens provides Assisted Living Services, while Wilton Meadows is a Rehabilitation and Healthcare facility. We welcome your child to write a note or draw a picture for a resident… it will surely brighten their day! Look for a mailbox in the lobby and help us send a valentine to members within our community.

### Cold Feet, Warm Hearts

Thank you for supporting our “Cold Feet, Warm Hearts” sock drive. We collected nearly 30 pairs of socks to help the Open Door Shelter in Norwalk. Open Door provides shelter with over 95 beds at their facilities, and also serves over 20,000 meals per month. Thank you for helping warming some toes!

## Important Notes

### Parking Lot

As winter descends, please be extra cautious in the parking lot. Although the plow does a pretty good job of getting the snow out of the way, icy patches can exist. Children should be with a responsible adult at all times and should not be running in the parking lot. Also, unless you have made arrangements to drop off your child with a staff member at the front door, please do not park along the curb. There is ample parking for everyone!

### Winter Clothing

Please remember we make every effort to go outside every day and the children need the appropriate clothing to be comfortable in the winter conditions outside. Please send in snow gear (hats, mittens, boots, snow pants… but no scarves, please, for safety reasons!). Please also remember to update your child’s spare clothing with a seasonally-appropriate set.

### Weather Related Delays and Cancellations

ZHPP’S policy is to follow the protocol of Wilton Public Schools with regard to weather-related delays and cancellations. If Wilton Public Schools are closed, ZHPP will be closed. If there is a one or a two-hour delay, we will begin our mornings at 10:30am. If there is a three-hour delay, ZHPP will be closed. If there is an early dismissal, we will end at 12:30pm or sooner, depending on the circumstances. In all instances of early dismissal, there will be no afternoon activities.

ZHPP uses both email and text messaging alerts in any weather related change to our schedule. If you would like to add a nanny or care-giver to our text/email chain, please let us know. There may be occasions when power/internet outages prevent us from sending emails/texts, but we make every effort to get the messages sent in a timely fashion. Please be certain to check as many sources as possible for up-to-date information and remember the general rule of thumb – we follow Wilton Public Schools!
