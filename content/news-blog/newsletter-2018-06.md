## From the Director’s Desk:

Dear Families,

It’s nearly June, and as a Director, June is always a bittersweet month. We welcome summer and celebrate the end of the school year and all of the accomplishments of your children. But we also have to say good-bye (I prefer to say until we see you again) to the families who have their final child heading off to Kindergarten.

The last year has been such a pleasure and I cherish the opportunities I had to see your children grow and learn in such a loving and nurturing environment. To our returning families, I look forward to many years of watching the journey of your children through the early years.

We were happy to bring more special programs to the children in May, including music, yoga and Spanish, as well as a special visit from Stamford Nature Center and the baby animals — the baby goat was especially well liked by all.

We also welcomed our student interns, Victoria Soule and Maria Alvarez, from Wilton High School. They will be spending time in all the classrooms to see what it is like to work with young children and will be with us through the middle of June.

In June we look forward to our rescheduled Family Fun Day, as well as the graduations and celebrations of the 4′s and 5′s and the end-of-year picnics. It is always great to see all of the family participation at these special activities.

Wishing everyone a fun and enjoyable summer!

## Special Events

### Mini Marathon

May 25  
9:15am

The Mini Marathon is a Zion’s Hill tradition that was started by a group of moms who enjoyed running. The event will take place on Friday, May 25 at 9:15am. Parents are invited to watch or run laps around the parking lot with the children while the staff members facilitate the race. There will be time keepers, a water station, start and finish lines and cheerleaders. The children will run 1 lap less than their age (2 year old – 1 lap, 5 year old – 4 laps). This is a fun event for all to partake in as a group. Spectators are welcome. If you are interested in running with your child’s class, please tell your child’s teacher.

### Memorial Day Parade

May 28

Any family wishing to participate in the Wilton Memorial Day parade with Zion’s Hill is welcome. Our group will walk the parade route together. The children march or ride in decorated wagons with their parents. Please respond to the Evite.

## Meet Our Interns!

### Maria Alonso

I’m 17 years old, currently a senior in Wilton High School. I have a big family, my parents and four siblings, I’m the second one. I’m from Spain, where I’ve lived most of my life, I’ve also spent two years in Mexico, and I finally came to Wilton in the summer of 2016. My plan for next year is to go back to Spain for college where I’ll study a double degree in education. My favorite activities are traveling, playing with my younger sister, skiing, hanging out with my friends, and volunteering with the YMCA in their different special needs activities.

### Victoria Soule

I am a senior at Wilton High School. In the fall, I will be attending Northeastern University in Boston, MA, as an environmental science major. I live with my mom (Miss Anna), my dad, my younger brother Christopher, and my rambunctious puppy Milo. In my free time, I enjoy photography, going for runs on the Norwalk River Valley Trail, and spending time in Maine with my family. I was a student at Zion’s Hill Preschool many years ago, and now I am looking forward to ending my school career in Wilton at the same place as I began.

## 2018-2019 School Year

Returning families, mark your calendars! Orientation for students will take place September 4-7. An orientation packet will be mailed in August and will include the date of your child’s first day of school. Class lists and teacher assignments will be made over the summer.

We’re already looking forward to welcoming the children back to school in the fall. In the meantime, we are planning some fun summer events so the children and families can stay connected over the break. Stay tuned for additional information.

Wishing you a happy summer!
