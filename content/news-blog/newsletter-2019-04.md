Knock, Knock  
Who’s there?  
Owls say  
Owls say who?  
Yes, they do.

Hee hee! No fooling, April is upon us – another month filled with laughter and fun! March was magical in its own right, with the first and only real snowfall of the year, and a special visit from Woodcock Nature Center. While Mr. Sam did not bring an owl, it was amazing to watch the wonder on the children’s faces as he presented his cast of characters… whether it was Chubbs (probably the biggest frog they had ever seen), Squirt the baby turtle, or the sticky-footed tree frog, they were totally delighted!

We have so many fun activities planned for April. First up, we will join a worldwide observance of Autism Awareness Day on April 2 (wear blue!). The children will work throughout the week to build special puzzles. Next up is a Spring Clean-up Play date on the 7th. We promise, it will be FUN as we band together to spruce up our playgrounds and provide our children a fresh place to play after the winter. Then we have a whole week of fun-filled activities as we celebrate the Week of the Young Child™ – we will tie dye shirts, wear silly hats, and proudly display our masterpieces in ZHPP’s own art show. The week will culminate with a Children’s Parade on Friday, April 12 at 9:15am – please stay after drop-off to celebrate our young learners. This will be the perfect springboard into Spring Break… after so much fun we’ll have all earned some R&R! But what could be MORE fun than Spring Fling? It is a terrific night to socialize with friends, make new connections, dance to your heart’s content, and score some fabulous auction items, all while benefiting ZHPP’s programming. Don’t miss out, get your RSVPs and song requests in!

Have Fun!

### Autism Awareness

Tuesday, April 2

Please join us in wearing blue on Tuesday, April 2 as we observe the 12th annual World Autism Awareness Day. Joined by the international community, hundreds of thousands of landmarks, buildings, homes and communities around the world wear light blue in recognition of people living with autism. Autism-friendly events and educational activities take place all month to increase understanding and acceptance and foster worldwide support. ZHPP is planning to work together to construct lots of puzzles!

### Spring Clean-up Play Date

The teachers are looking forward to Spring Conferences beginning mid-April and going through early May. It is a great opportunity to share information on your child’s day, development, and progression since the Fall. Please watch for sign-ups and don’t hesitate to see the office with any questions.
Week of the Young Child

In honor of The Week of the Young Child, April 8-12, we will bring five fun-filled days to ZHPP to celebrate our little learners! This is an annual celebration sponsored by the National Association for the Education of Young Children (NAEYC) to spotlight early learning, young children, their teachers, families and communities.

## Join the ZHPP Board

The Board is comprised of parent volunteers who share their talents and give back to the school that gives our children and families so much. We meet one evening a month to plan programs and activities for the school, set policies, address suggestions from parents and staff, review the budget and ensure the delivery of our mission statement.

As families graduate from ZHPP, openings on the Board become available. We are looking for both mothers and fathers who are interested in serving for the 2019-2020 school year and invite you to join us!

Please contact Heather Bravi (heather.bravi@gmail.com), Melissa Leonard (mwalker521@gmail.com) or Rebecca Hickey (rhickey1221@gmail.com) for more information or to request an application.

## Important Notes

### Extended-Day Adventures

Join us for extended learning until 3:00pm! Themed Afternoon Adventures occur daily from 12:30-3:00pm for the 3′s and 4′s. After a brief rest period to regroup, the children do a variety of activities and enjoy additional outdoor time. This is a great opportunity for children in the 4′s program to begin transitioning to longer school days ahead!

* Monday: Games and Gadgets
* Tuesday: Spanish with Señora Vicky (these small group sessions are always popular!)
* Wednesday: Building and Design
* Thursday: Cooking with Friends
* Friday: Fun with Fitness

Spaces are limited, so if you would like your child(ren) to participate please sign up 24 hours in advance. Payment of $42 per session is due upon sign-up. And 2′s can stay too, they usually have a longer rest period.

### Drop-in Days for 3′s and 4′s

Looking to help your child build stamina for a greater number of school days? Need a day for an appointment, a meeting, or for YOU? We can help!

ZHPP is now offering a Monday drop-in for our 4’s students, and a Tuesday/Thursday drop-in for our 3′s! For our 4′s currently enrolled Tuesday to Friday, students can drop-in for extra learning, play, and socialization on Mondays in Miss Marissa’s class. And for our 3′s, students can spend Tuesday and/or Thursday mornings with Miss Tracey. Spaces are limited, and advanced notice is kindly requested. The cost is $50 per day, 9:00am-12:30pm. Please stop by the office to sign-up!

### Dismissal

A gentle reminder that children must be supervised at all times during dismissal. Upstairs is space-constrained and there can be many little bodies (and rest cots!) underfoot. Please feel free to chat with friends or your child’s teacher in the movement room to keep the traffic flowing. Downstairs is ripe for running races through the hallway; please feel free to let the children expend some extra energy in the playgrounds and yard (just be sure to close the gates afterward!).
