## From the Director’s Desk:

Welcome back and Happy New Year! I hope you all had a relaxing and enjoyable holiday season. It is hard to believe that this newsletter marks the one year anniversary of my tenure at Zion’s Hill Preschool Program. It has been such an amazing year for me. Coming into such a warm and welcoming environment from the start, has helped me develop both personally and professionally.

Zion’s Hill Preschool Program is so fortunate to have such a wonderful staff, dedicated parents, and community support.  Over the course of the year, it has been so rewarding to work with the parent run Board of Directors who give so much of their time and talents to the school. In addition to the Board, there are many other parents who help out with class parties, volunteer in the classroom and with other school activities.  When life events such as child birth or the passing of a loved one occur, the ZHPP community pulls together to show our support for these families.

With the generous contributions of our families, we have created two new beautiful learning environments for the children including the movement room and library. Additionally, our Tadpoles communication system allows all of you to see the fantastic daily activities your children get to do within their classrooms.

The family fun days, summer concerts and playground clean-ups are just another example of the joint efforts between the school and the families to make ZHPP stand out.

While there have been many changes throughout the year, the entire ZHPP community has embraced them all with joy! I am looking forward to another year of fun, enthusiasm, fostering both old and new relationships, and enjoying all the special moments to come in 2017!

## Important Notes

### School Pictures

Please return the pictures you do not wish to keep along with your payment to the office by Friday, January 6.

### Breakfast Club – New Option

We now offer two different drop off times for Breakfast Club, 8:00 or 8:30am daily. The fee is $12 for the hour and $7 for 30 minutes and includes a light breakfast of cereal and fruit. We require a 24-hour registration notification to schedule staff accordingly. Additionally, if you need to cancel, 24 hours’ notice is requested.

### Changing Weather

Please remember to dress your child appropriately with the change of seasons and upcoming winter weather. We go outside every day and the children need the appropriate clothing according to the weather forecast and conditions outside. Try to send in clothing that your child can independently manage. Please also remember to update your child’s spare clothing with appropriate change of clothing in case it is needed. Layers always work well.

### School Closings, Delays, and Dismissals

Please remember that we follow the Wilton Public School schedule for weather-related closings, delays, and early dismissals. If there is a delayed opening, ZHPP will begin at 10:30am. If there is an early dismissal, ZHPP will dismiss at 12:30pm, with no afternoon programs. We will advise of any weather-related schedule changes via text message and email.

### Parking

Please use caution in the parking lot as the weather gets colder. There may be ice patches under the snow that we can not see. Children should not be permitted to run on the sidewalk, or in the lot during the winter season. Additionally, please be courteous to the individuals who have reserved parking spaces. These include the Runestad Family and Pastor Peggy.
