The school year is off to a great start! The children have had a smooth transition into their new classroom and for many, into their new school, as well.  The teachers are having so much fun getting to know each and every one of them through their home visits and classroom interactions.  I’ve been stopping by to say “Hello” every day and I’m truly loving all the hugs, smiles and high fives that I get in each classroom.

The days are flying by with all of our special activities in full swing.  It was great to see so many of our families at the Fall Family Fun Day.  Your children are super heroes at school when they share, interact and have positive interactions with their peers and teachers.  The Pied Piper petting zoo was a ton of fun for all the children.  The ducks, sheep and goats were super cute and great for comparing how they felt.  Miss Joanne was back to teach music and Miss Andrea from the Wilton Library paid us a visit.  October will be full of more excitement when the Wilton Fire Department stops by with the fire truck, Yoga begins, and everyone will participate in our ever so popular Halloween Parades.

The teachers work hard to make all the children comfortable and happy so by mid-October, the school is virtually tear free. This is great for Picture Days on October 13th and 14th. Since these days are right after our long holiday weekend, a morning reminder will be sent on the day of pictures. Please be sure to have your text alerts set up for this to occur.

On top of all these activities, the Afternoon Adventures have been crowd pleasers, so be sure to sign-up as soon as possible to guarantee a spot. This week the children played some games on the new SmartBoard on Monday and learned counting and songs in Spanish on Tuesday. Wednesday was fun as they explored the variety of buildings at the school and talked about the designs of each including materials used, shapes they could see and number of doors and windows. On Thursday, the crew cooked up some delicious strawberry and banana fruit parfaits and on Friday, the extra time in the movement room was so much fun.  The rock wall is definitely a workout for the children and the basketball game was super enjoyable-of course the children beat the teachers.

Girl Scout Troop 50600 completed their Bronze Award by planting a Sensory Garden near the lower playground. To achieve this – the highest honor for a Girl Scout Junior – a troop must select a project that will leave a lasting impact on the community.  ZHPP has had a lasting impact on the young women – almost all are alumni! Our children can explore the beautiful garden, filled with herbs and plants, and our teachers can further incorporate scientific discovery into their daily learning.  Thank you, Troop 50600, and congratulations!

I’m looking forward to everyone falling into all the fun and festivities this month.

## Fundraising – Annual Appeal

Every year Zion’s Hill holds two fundraisers, one in the fall, our Annual Appeal, and another one in the spring, Spring Fling. Financial contributions from families during these fundraisers support the continued operations and improvement of the school. Tax-deductible gifts to both fundraisers enable us to maintain and enhance our curriculum and upgrade our classroom materials and facilities.

We will be kicking off our Annual Appeal in October.  Please be on the look out for additional information in your mailbox. We will kick off the event with colorful lobby decorations on Tuesday. If you have any questions, please contact Melanie Will at melaniebwill@gmail.com or Yana Dusheyko at yanina.dusheyko@gmail.com. We look forward to your participation and thank you in advance for your consideration!

## Tadpoles

Keeping our families informed and involved with the school has always been a priority of ours.  We were therefore very excited to be able to introduce Tadpoles in the spring.  A valuable communication tool,  the Tadpoles program allows our teachers to capture special moments, take photos, and videos of the children in action as well as send you classroom information.

We hope you have enjoyed seeing your child experience the many amazing moments and places at Zion’s Hill, from the Movement Room and Library to their classroom and playgrounds, and to the many visitors they welcomed this month including the Wilton Library, Miss Jo Anne and Pied Piper Petting Zoo.

With any new program, we welcome your feedback.  Please share your comments with your child’s teacher or Kelly.

## Important Notes

### Safety Reminder

We welcome the children to play outside after school and ask that you please use the playgrounds. Please do not allow children to run near the parking lot at pick-up.

### Additional Reminders

Please kindly park in one of the designated parking spots and not the bend of the parking lot unless all spaces are full. This makes it difficult for larger vehicles to make the turn.

When signing in, please indicate the first and last name of the person who will be picking up.

Pick up time is 12:30 for our core program and 3:00 for Afternoon Adventures and Extensions.

Please send a healthy lunch containing 2-3 items including one protein. It is a ZHPP practice to not serve candy during our lunch period.

### Afternoon Adventures and Extensions

Our extended day programs are offered on a drop-in or contract basis.  If you are interested in contracting for either a semester or the full year, please stop by the office to complete a registration form.  There is a 2.5% savings over the drop in rate for semester contracts and a 5% savings for a full year contract.

### Forms Due
If you have not done so already, please remember to turn in the following forms to the office: (1) signed acknowledgement page from the back of your handbook, (2) photo permission form and (3) volunteer form.  Thank you.
