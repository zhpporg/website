Dear Families,

It is certainly invigorating to see the green grass and daffodils (and even the dandelions) popping out of the moist soil — such a lush and welcomed sight. A special thank you to those who helped spruce up the playgrounds and yards at Spring Clean-up — everything looks great! The children love the outdoor spaces and are easily energized by fresh air and exercise… with special Zion’s Hill traditions in May they will have plenty of both!

We had a wonderful lead-up to April break with the Week of the Young Child. What better way to celebrate our young ones than with an art show of their own creations, crazy hats, special stuffed animals, and pizza? Many, many thanks to our 3’s teacher Miss Bridget who worked tirelessly with each age class to make the spectacular tie-dye shirts, each as unique as the children that proudly donned them at the parade. A sight to behold as they circled the parking lot, and a good warm up for the upcoming Mini Marathon!

Spring Conferences have begun and are scheduled throughout May, so be sure to check with your child’s teacher if you haven’t already. This is a great time to catch up and hear all the wonderful growth that has occurred throughout the year.

It was lovely to see so many of you at Spring Fling — what a night! Thank you to all who made the evening possible. Your support allows us to offer the outstanding programming for which we are known, and so many “extras” that set ZHPP apart — from Music to Masterpiece, Bikes to Balance Beams, and Spanish to Smartboard — we are committed to maintaining our enriching curriculum, and providing even more unique experiences for your children. THANK YOU for your generosity.

Sincerely,  
Anne and Jessica

## Special Events

### Bike Day

Wednesday, May 15

Calling all cyclists! The 4′s classes will participate in ZHPP’s annual Bike Day on Wednesday, May 15. Each child may park their bike and helmet near the front of the building at drop-off time. The teachers will take the children out during the day to ride around the parking lot — they love practicing their pedaling! Please see the office with any questions.

### Mini Marathon

Friday, May 24  
9:15am

On your mark, get set, go! Lace up your sneakers for another favorite Zion’s Hill tradition — the Mini Marathon! Started by a group of moms that enjoy running, this fun event is perfect for little legs (and for parents too!). Families are invited to cheer on or run around the parking lot with the children: 1 lap for the 2′s, 2 laps for the 3′s, and 3 laps for the 4′s. The staff will be at the start and finish lines to keep official time and record any photo finishes, and will also man the water station. Please let your child’s teacher know if you are interested in running with your child’s class.

### Parent Teacher Conferences

Spring Conferences have begun and are scheduled throughout May. This is a great time to catch up and hear all the wonderful growth that has occurred throughout the year. Please don’t hesitate to see the office with any questions.
