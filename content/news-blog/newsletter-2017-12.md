## From the Director’s Desk:

Dear Parents,

November was another busy month, and Mother Nature gave us such beautiful weather to enjoy.

Our horse-drawn hay rides were a huge success on a fantastic fall day. The children admired the draft horses as we rode through the parking lots of the school and church. All of the children enjoyed another round of yoga, music, library, and Spanish, where Senora Vicky taught some words related to Thanksgiving!

The end of the month was extra special as our 4′s and 5′s classes hosted a Thanksgiving Feast for their families. The children cooked throughout the week, filling the air with wonderful smells, and worked extra hard on their special table decorations. It was wonderful to see all the smiles on the faces as the children sang, “Simple Gifts.

Our food drive was a huge success with all classrooms participating. The food will be delivered to Person-to-Person to assist local families through the holiday season.

Although a shortened month, December will be as busy as ever. The children will be learning about all of the holidays, and we invite parents to share the special holiday traditions your families celebrate. The school community will come together on December 15 for the annual Holiday Sing-Along after drop-off.

Will we be dashing through the snow? No one knows, but we will enjoy all the joys of the season throughout the month.

## Important Notes

### Parent Teacher Conferences

Parent Teacher conferences will be held this month. The teachers put a lot of time and effort into the information that they are going to share with you, so please come prepared and do not hesitate to ask questions. You will see a sign-up sheet in your child’s classroom. See the Director if you have any questions.

### Communications

We have heard from a number of parents that school communications have been placed in their spam, junk and promotions files instead of their inbox. This is particularly true with Gmail and Yahoo accounts. You should be receiving daily Tadpole reports and occasional communications from your classroom teacher through the zhpp.orgemail accounts. If this is not happening, please confirm your email address with your classroom teachers and check your email folders.

### Changing Weather

Please remember to dress your child appropriately for the change of seasons and upcoming winter weather. We go outside every day and the children need the appropriate clothing according to the weather forecast and conditions outside. Try to send in clothing that your child can independently manage. Please also remember to update your child’s spare clothing with appropriate change of clothing in case it is needed. Layers always work well.

### Weather-Related Delays and Cancellations

Please be advised that it is ZHPP’S policy to follow the protocol of Wilton Public Schools for delays and closings due to the effects of Mother Nature. If there is a delay, we will begin our mornings at 10:30 am. If there is an early dismissal, we will end at 12:30 pm with no afternoon activities. A closing will be followed once the district announces it.

There are multiple ways to find out about these events which include emails from the school, text messages from the school, NBC Connecticut, or the local radio. There may be occasions when certain methods of communication fail because of power and internet outages. Please be certain to check multiple sources for up-to-date information.
