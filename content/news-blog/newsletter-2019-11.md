## Grateful in November

Dear Families,

As October ends, we officially close the book on “back to school” mode, which culminated in our Fall Family Fun Day and Parent Open House. We loved seeing so many of you and showcasing our school. Picture Day has also come and gone—we can’t wait for you to see the happy, adorable faces! The children have adjusted to their classroom environments and are enjoying all of the “extras” ZHPP provides, from singing and downward-dogging with Miss JoAnne, to learning Spanish with Señora Vicky, to climbing on fire trucks during Fire Prevention Week. The Four’s and Five’s classes have taken their first field trip to Ambler Farm and learned all about Vincent Van Gogh from Miss Christine’s “Star” themed Masterpiece class. It was such a treat for Miss Brenda and me to see the ZHPP Triangle Orchestra’s performance of Mozart’s “Twinkle Twinkle Little Star.” Spectacular!

The coming weeks will find us celebrating even more ZHPP fall traditions, including the Halloween parade, hayrides, and the annual Thanksgiving Feast for our Four’s and Five’s families. The feast has to be my all-time favorite event at ZHPP! I love the delicious scents filling our hallways as the children prepare muffins, stuffing, and sides; I love working with the staff to decorate the hall; I love helping to serve a fine spread (and picking at the leftovers!); most of all, I love seeing families take pause and spend time with the children and one another. I am thankful for the entire ZHPP community, from the dedicated Board of Directors to my amazing co-workers, from the supportive families and caregivers to the delightful children, all of whom make our preschool such a special place!

Gratefully,
Jessica

## Fundraising

### Fall Parent Social a Success

The ZHPP Fall Parent Social was held Saturday, September 28. A good time was had by all and it was especially nice to see many new families at the event! The ZHPP Board of Directors would like to thank the Haggerty family for being wonderful hosts.

### Box Top Outreach Campaign

ZHPP is collecting Box Tops to benefit Miller-Driscoll School, with a friendly competition attached—prizes will be awarded! Best of all, thanks to the generosity of one of our families, a cash donation match (up to $500) will be made directly to ZHPP. Look for the display for additional details and the collection mailbox in the foyer, and start clipping!

## Other News

### Weather-Related Delays and Cancelations

ZHPP policy is to follow Wilton Public Schools with regard to weather-related delays and cancellations. If Wilton Public Schools are closed, ZHPP will be closed. If there is a one- or a two-hour delay, we will begin our mornings at 10:30. If there is a three-hour delay, ZHPP will be closed. If there is an early dismissal, we will end at 12:30 or sooner, depending on the circumstances. In all instances of early dismissal, there will be no afternoon activities.

ZHPP uses both email and text messaging alerts in any weather related change to our schedule. If you would like to add a caregiver to our system, please let us know. There may be occasions when power/internet outages prevent us from sending emails/texts, but we make every effort to get the messages sent in a timely fashion. Please be certain to check as many sources as possible for up-to-date information and remember the general rule of thumb—we follow Wilton Public Schools.

### Rest Update

Sweet dreams, everyone! While the rest portion of our day is going smoothly, the laundry pile-up from the “loaner” blankets is a challenge. Please send in a blanket for your child on his or her rest days. It can remain in the cubby if you prefer (assuming it’s a spare). Thank you!

### Visiting Consultants and Aides

From time to time you may notice some new faces in our classrooms. As the need arises, we may have visiting consultants and aides perform observations and support. If you ever have questions, please don’t hesitate to ask your teacher or the office staff.

## Extended Programming

### Early Bird

This offering allows parents to drop off their child at 8 or 8:30, before the start of our core program. All children attending Early Bird meet in the same assigned classroom and enjoy relaxed, age-appropriate activities. Parents are welcome to send breakfast for their child. At 8:55, the children are escorted by staff to their regular classrooms.

### Afternoon Adventures

Our wonderful extended day programs for the Three’s, Four’s, and Five’s are designed so your child can learn, play, and explore a new skill in a caring and nurturing environment. Afternoon Adventures include a short rest, focused instruction from our teachers, snack, and playground time. Each program runs from 12:30–3.

Choose the day or days that appeal to your budding adventurer:

* Monday – Games and Gadgets
* Tuesday – Building and Design
* Wednesday – Spanish Language
* Thursday – Kids’ Kitchen
* Friday – Fun with Fitness

### Extensions for Two’s
Extended day options are available for our Two’s as well, with less emphasis on focused instruction and more time for rest and free play. Extensions also include snack and playground time, and run from 12:30–3. Extensions for Two’s start the week of September 16.

### Drop-in Days for Four’s

ZHPP offers a Monday drop-in. For our Four′s currently enrolled Tuesday to Friday, students can drop in for extra learning, play, and socialization on Mondays in Miss Tracey’s class. Spaces are limited, and advanced notice is kindly requested. The cost is $50 per day, 9–12:30. Please stop by the office to sign up.

Sign-ups for Extensions MUST be completed at least 24 hours in advance of the Extension day.

## Reminders

### Changing Weather

Please remember to dress your child for the upcoming winter weather. We attempt to go outside every day and the children need the appropriate clothing to be comfortable in the conditions. Please try to send in clothing that your child can independently manage. Also, please remember to update your child’s spare clothing with a seasonally-appropriate set.

### Tuition Payments

ZHPP does not send invoices for tuition. Please remit your payment to the office on or before the due date.

### Pick-Ups
Please be sure to notify the office and your child’s teacher if someone other than you will be picking up your child. We will also check the driver’s license or another form of ID when alternative pick-up arrangements are made.

### Parking Lot Safety

Please use extreme caution when driving and walking in the parking lot—many little bodies are underfoot and can be difficult to see! Hold your child’s hand and watch for cars. We recommend entering through the lower driveway and exiting from the upper driveway during the busy drop-off and pick-up times.

### ZHPP Is an Allergy-Aware Environment

We ask that parents be aware of the foods that they send in children’s lunches. We do not allow peanut butter, nuts, or foods containing nuts. We will send home any products that state on the label that it comes from a plant that processes nuts. In addition, we send home food that looks like it contains nuts.
