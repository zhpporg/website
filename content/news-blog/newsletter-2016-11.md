The month of October has been filled with so much fun and excitement.  The children have been able to make many wonderful memories while exploring the ZHPP environment.  Mother Nature has been throwing in her own surprises and we are taking full advantage of it with picnics, bike riding, nature walks, and extra outdoor time.  It was so great to see so many of our parents attend the Open House on October 13th.  The teachers were delighted to share about your children’s days and the slide show that brought some of you to tears.  For those parents that were unable to join us, we do not want you to miss out on seeing all the great things your children do throughout the day.  There will be an encore presentation after drop off on November 9th.  It takes 10 minutes to view, but is worth every second.  If you already saw it but want to see it again, please join us for a coffee and conversation too!

While we had 5 days off of school, the month was jammed packed with events.  The Wilton Fire Department visited the children to learn about fire safety and show off the fire truck, of course.  The Pied Piper petting zoo returned for our little ones, while our 4′s and 5′s went to Castle Hill Farms to pick pumpkins, go on a hay ride, and solve a corn maze.  Picture day came with a lot of smiles and a few precious pictures of tears, but the day was a success.  We can’t wait to see the final product.  Thanks to the moms who were the extra set of hands and silly faces to get those smiles captured.

The upcoming months are going to showcase the loving nature of ZHPP.  November will be highlighted with the older children holding a Thanksgiving Feast, we will be hosting a food drive for the Wilton Food Pantry, followed by having our school be a local drop off spot for Toys for Tots.

I’m looking forward to my first holiday season at ZHPP and the magical moments they bring to the faces of the little ones!

## Important Notes

### Parent Teacher Conferences

Parent Teacher conferences will be held this month. The teachers put a lot of time and effort into the information that they are going to share with you, so please come prepared and do not hesitate to ask questions.  You will see a sign-up sheet in your child’s classroom.  See Kelly if you have any questions.

### Communications

We have heard from a number of parents that school communications have been placed in their spam, junk and promotions files instead of their inbox.  This is particularly true with Gmail and Yahoo accounts.  You should be receiving daily Tadpole reports and occasional communications from your classroom teacher through the zhpp.org email accounts.  If this is not happening, please confirm your email address with your classroom teachers and check your email folders.

### Breakfast Club

Breakfast club is available from 8:00-9:00 AM daily.  This is a great option for those parents that may have appointments or early morning meetings.  It is only $12 for the hour and includes a light breakfast of cereal and fruit.  We do require a 24 hour registration notification to schedule staffing accordingly.  Additionally, if you need to cancel, 24 hours’ notice is requested.

### Changing Weather

Please remember to dress your child appropriately with the change of seasons and upcoming winter weather. We go outside every day and the children need the appropriate clothing according to the weather forecast and conditions outside. Try to send in clothing that your child can independently manage.  Please also remember to update your child’s spare clothing with appropriate change of clothing in case it is needed. Layers always work well.
