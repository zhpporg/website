## From the Director’s Desk:

Dear Parents,

The month of October has been filled with so much fun and excitement. The children have been able to make many wonderful memories while exploring the ZHPP environment. Mother Nature has been throwing in her own surprises and we are taking full advantage of it with picnics, bike riding, nature walks, and extra outdoor time. It was so great to see so many of our parents attend the Open House on October 3rd. The teachers were delighted to share about your children’s days, and we know parents love to watch the annual student slideshow!

October seemed to fly by as it was jam-packed with events. The Wilton Fire Department visited the children to learn about fire safety and show off the fire truck, of course. Our Fours and Fives went to Castle Hill Farm to pick pumpkins, go on a hayride, and solve a corn maze. We sang songs about the fire trucks in music, had fun with Senora Vicky and became trees in yoga class, too.

The upcoming months are set to showcase the loving nature of the ZHPP community. In November we will celebrate the Thanksgiving Feast with the older children. And in December we will host a food drive for Person-to-Person, serve as a local drop-off spot for Toys for Tots, and enjoy festivities like our annual Holiday Sing-Along.

I’m looking forward to the upcoming holiday season at ZHPP and the expressions of joy on the little ones’ faces during all of those magical moments!

## Important Notes

### Parent Teacher Conferences

Parent Teacher conferences will be held this month. The teachers put a lot of time and effort into the information that they are going to share with you, so please come prepared and do not hesitate to ask questions. You will see a sign-up sheet in your child’s classroom. See Kelly if you have any questions.

### Communications

We have heard from a number of parents that school communications have been placed in their spam, junk and promotions files instead of their inbox. This is particularly true with Gmail and Yahoo accounts. You should be receiving daily Tadpole reports and occasional communications from your classroom teacher through the zhpp.org email accounts. If this is not happening, please confirm your email address with your classroom teachers and check your email folders.

### Breakfast Club

Breakfast club is available from 8:00-9:00 am or 8:30-9:00 amdaily. This is a great option for those parents that may have appointments or early morning meetings.  The rate is $14 for the hour and includes a light breakfast of cereal and fruit. The cost for a half hour is $8. We do require a 24 hour registration notification to schedule staffing accordingly. Additionally, if you need to cancel, 24 hours’ notice is requested.

### Changing Weather

Please remember to dress your child appropriately for the change of seasons and upcoming winter weather. We go outside every day and the children need the appropriate clothing according to the weather forecast and conditions outside. Try to send in clothing that your child can independently manage. Please also remember to update your child’s spare clothing with appropriate change of clothing in case it is needed. Layers always work well.

### Weather-Related Delays and Cancellations

Please be advised that it is ZHPP’S policy to follow the protocol of Wilton Public Schools for delays and closings due to the effects of Mother Nature. If there is a delay, we will begin our mornings at 10:30 am. If there is an early dismissal, we will end at 12:30 pm with no afternoon activities. A closing will be followed once the district announces it.

There are multiple ways to find out about these events which include emails from the school, text messages from the school, NBC Connecticut, or the local radio. There may be occasions when certain methods of communication fail because of power and internet outages. Please be certain to check multiple sources for up-to-date information.
