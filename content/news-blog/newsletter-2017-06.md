## From the Director’s Desk:

Dear Families,

It’s nearly June, and as a Director, June is always a bittersweet month. We welcome summer and celebrate the end of the school year and all of the accomplishments that your children have made.  But we also have to say good-bye, (I prefer to say until we see you again) to some of the families who have their final child heading off to Kindergarten and the children who have reached this special milestone in their lives.

The last year has been such a pleasure to watch your children blossom in so many ways.  I will cherish the opportunities of watching your children grow and learn in such a loving and nurturing environment. To the families that are returning, I look forward to many years of continuing to watch the journey of your children through the early years.

We were also happy to bring more special programs to the children in May, which included music, yoga and Spanish, as well as a special visit from Stamford Nature Center and the baby animals.  This was very exciting to all of the children and staff alike.

Family Fun Day was a huge success and such a joy to see all of the families get together.  The weather could not have been better to enjoy all the camping activities, hot dogs and ice cream.

May also gave us the opportunity to welcome student intern, Elizabeth Healy, from Wilton High School. She will be spending time in all the classrooms to see what it is like to work with young children.  She will be with us through the middle of June.

The end of year activities will be sure to please, as we look forward to  the graduations and celebrations of the 4′s and 5′s and the end of year picnics.  It is always great to see all of the family participation at these special activities.

Wishing everyone a fun and enjoyable summer!
