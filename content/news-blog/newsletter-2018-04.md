## From the Director’s Desk:

April Showers Bring May Flowers

Dear Families,

March didn’t offer the best beginning to spring, but we made the most of it with special indoor activities like making Kool-Aid scented playdough, and a field trip to Ambler Farm for the 4′s and 5′s where they got to learn about maple sugaring and see brand new baby chicks.

We begin April with yoga to help us ease into the month, then all will enjoy a much needed Spring Break. I hope your families get to do some fun and exciting activities together!

Upon our return, we will celebrate your children with the “Week of the Young Child” — a week of fun and adventure for all the children, and a few activities for the parents as well. The first week back will culminate with our annual Spring Fling Social for parents and we hope to see everyone there! To finish off the month we will learn Spanish with Miss Vicky and read books with Miss Andrea from Wilton Library.

I hope you will be able to join some of the very special activities happening this month. After all, as Robin Williams said, “Spring is Nature’s way of saying, ‘Let’s Party!’ ”

## Autism Awareness

Please join the staff in wearing blue on Tuesday, April 3 as we take part in Autism Awareness Month.

This cause is near and dear to many of us as we have family members and friends who face daily challenges. Autism Awareness Month seeks to increase understanding and acceptance and foster worldwide support.

## Important Notes

### Tick Control

We would like you to be aware that CT Tick Control sprays our property for ticks 3 times a year. This company is approved by the state of Connecticut. The first application will be later this month.

### Playgrounds & Gates

With the nicer weather, you and your child/ren may depart from outside and through the side gates. To ensure safety, we ask that the gates be opened by adults only; please remember to close them.

If you choose to add a little extra play time on the playground at the end of the day, please clean up and close the gate.

### Extended-Day Adventures

Did you know that your child can extend their learning until 3:00pm? Themed Afternoon Adventures occur daily from 12:30-3:00pm for the 3′s, 4′s and 5′s. After a brief rest period to regroup, the children do a variety of activities and enjoy additional outdoor time.

* Monday: Games and Gadgets
* Tuesday: Spanish with Señora Vicky (these small group sessions are always popular!)
* Wednesday: Building and Design
* Thursday: Cooking
* Friday: Fitness Fun

Spaces are limited, so if you would like your child(ren) to participate please sign up 24 hours in advance. Payment of $42 per session is due upon sign-up.

This is a great opportunity for children in the 4′s and 5′s programs to begin transitioning to a longer day. Kindergarten is a big adjustment so helping them get a jump start is always beneficial!

### Buildings & Grounds: Spring Clean-Up

Our landscapers will be in sometime this month for a “spring clean-up.” This will include removing leaves and debris, weeding, raking back mulch from the fences to maintain the required height, adding lots more sand to our sandboxes, adding mulch to the playgrounds and whatever else needs sprucing up.
