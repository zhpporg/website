## Let the Fall Fun Begin!

### From the Director’s Desk:

Dear Parents,

The school year is off to a great start! The children have had a smooth transition into their new classrooms and for many, into their new school as well. The teachers are having so much fun getting to know each and every one of them through home visits and classroom interactions. I was able to spend time in each of the classrooms and enjoyed all of the conversations with your little ones.

The days are flying and our special activities are in full swing. The children loved having their faces painted and arms tattooed at Family Fun Day. Creating fall wreaths, having free reign of the playgrounds and enjoying a visit from Wilton Police rounded out a wonderful event. Parents celebrated the beginning of autumn with a great evening at the home of the Haggerty Family (special thanks to Michelle and Howard for hosting).

October will be full of more excitement when the Wilton Fire Department stops by with the fire truck, music and yoga begin, and everyone participates in our ever-so-popular Halloween Parades. Let the fun and festivities begin!

### Note from the Board

The year is off to a great start and we are grateful to our amazing staff for hitting the ground running! As you all are aware, the Director began her leave last week. We are fortunate to have Anne Gaston and Jessica Joy keeping things running smoothly during this time. If you have any questions, please stop by the office or email them at zhppdirector@gmail.com.

We enjoyed seeing many of you at the Parent Social last weekend. It was a great evening in a beautiful setting. Next up is Open House on Tuesday, October 9th. You will have the opportunity to learn more about our play-based curriculum, see your child’s classroom and his/her creations and speak with your child’s teacher. After, many of us will convene at Craft 14 for some adult conversation and hope to see you there!

Sincerely,
Melissa and Heather

## Extended Day Programming

### Afternoon Adventures

Our wonderful extended day programs for the Three’s and Four’s are designed so your child can learn, play and explore a new skill in a caring and nurturing environment. Afternoon Adventures include a short rest, focused instruction from our teachers, snack and playground time. Each program runs from 12:30–3:00pm.

Choose the day or days that appeal to your budding adventurer:

* Monday – Games and Gadgets
* Tuesday – Spanish Language
* Wednesday – Building and Design
* Thursday – Cooking with Friends

### Extensions for Two’s
Extended day options are available for our Two’s on Tuesdays and Wednesdays, with less emphasis on focused instruction and more time for rest and free play. Extensions also include snack and playground time, and run from 12:30–3:00pm.

### Breakfast Club
This offering allows parents to drop off their child at 8:00am or 8:30am, before the start of our core program. All children in the Breakfast Club will meet in the same assigned classroom and enjoy quiet age-appropriate activities and a healthy breakfast provided by the school (until 8:40am). At 8:55am, the children will be escorted to their regular classrooms by a staff member.

## Important Notes

### Visiting Therapists and Aides

From time to time you may notice some new faces in our classrooms. As the need arises for some children, we may have visiting therapists and aides in the classroom. While these needs are sometimes confidential, if you ever have questions as to who someone is, please don’t hesitate to ask your teacher or the office staff.

### Board of Directors

There are still a few spots remaining on the Board of Directors for the 2018-2019 academic year. We invite you to consider volunteering for a position and support the school that gives so much to our children. Please contact the Board Co-Chairs Melissa Leonard (mwalker521@gmail.com) or Heather Bravi (heather.bravi@gmail.com) with any questions.

###Enrollment

ZHPP has a few openings remaining for the 2018-19 school year. If you or someone you know are interested in enrollment, please contact Anne Gaston or Jessica Joy (zhppdirector@gmail.com) for more information.

### Tuition Payments

ZHPP does not send invoices for tuition. Please kindly remit your payment to the office on or before the due date.

### Pick-Ups

Please be sure to notify the office and your child’s teacher when someone other than you will be picking up your child. Also, please remind that person to bring a driver’s license for identification.

### Parking Lot Safety

Please use extreme caution when driving and walking in the parking lot. Hold your child’s hand. Remind your friends and family when they pick up your child to use extra caution in the parking lot. We recommend driving in the lower driveway and out the upper driveway during the busy morning drop off.

### ZHPP Is an Allergy-Aware Environment

We ask that parents be aware of the foods that they send in their children’s lunches. We do not allow peanut butter, nuts or foods containing nuts. We will send home any products that state on the label that it comes from a plant that processes nuts. In addition, we send home food that looks like it contains nuts.
