## Happy Summer!

Dear Parents,

It’s hard to believe we are in the home stretch, heading toward the finish line of another wonderful year at ZHPP! And speaking of finish line, how great was the Mini-Marathon?!?!? The children loved it and the special annual tradition allowed us to see how much growth – both physically and developmentally – has transpired this year. Year-end brings the perfect opportunity to celebrate our little learners, but it is bittersweet too. We will miss being greeted by many smiling faces each morning, and for some of you, we will eagerly await reports back from your child’s next chapter in learning! It has been an absolute pleasure, and a true honor, to have been a part of your children’s early childhood education. Enjoy all the fun and laughter the next few weeks will bring (and perhaps some proud tears too as we marvel at how much our loved ones have grown). These years are precious, your children are precious, and we thank you for letting the ZHPP family be a part of your family.

Happy Summer,  
Jessica and Anne

## 2019-2020 School Year

We do not want to rush summer away, but we have been making many preparations for the 2019-2020 school year, and are thrilled to share some exciting news! We have some teachers taking on new roles, and a new teacher to welcome aboard!

The following are the teaching teams:

* 2′s: Miss Anna and Miss Danielle (M/W/F); Miss Anna and Miss Deb (Tu/Th), Miss Danielle and Miss Karen (Tu/Th)
* 3′s: Miss Louise and Miss Bridget (M-F): Miss Jenny and Miss Clare (M/W/F)
* 4′s: Miss Tracey with Miss Anne and Miss Meg (M-F); Miss Kristen and Miss Sarah (Tu-F)
* 5′s: Miss Marissa with Miss Christine and Miss Sally (M-F)
* Floaters: Miss Kathy and Miss Diane

Many of you know Miss Jenny (Blumenfeld) as Miss Louise’s talented partner these past few years, and know she will be a fantastic lead teacher! Many of you also know Miss Clare (Passaro), a ZHPP mom, board member, and now new teacher! Miss Tracey is excited to return to her roots in the 4′s, as is Miss Anne, and along with Miss Meg this is a phenomenal team! Miss Marissa will be fulfilling a long-held professional goal of teaching the 5′s and will be supported by Miss Sally and Miss Christine. With the assistance from our floaters, Miss Kathy and Miss Diane, Team ZHPP is poised for a sensational year ahead!

Returning families, mark your calendars! Meet the Teacher Days will occur on August 27 and 28, and orientation for students will be held August 29-30. An orientation packet will be mailed over the summer and will include the date and time of your child’s Meet the Teacher and orientation days. Student placement and teacher assignments will be determined over the summer. Please note that while we cannot take specific requests, classroom and teacher determinations are made through a very thoughtful and thorough approach to ensure that placement, like all of our procedures, consider the best interests of each and every child.

While we’re already looking forward to a new school year, we are also planning some fun summer events so the children and families can stay connected over the break. Stay tuned for additional information.

## Join the ZHPP Board

The Board is comprised of parent volunteers who share their talents and give back to the school that gives our children and families so much. We meet one evening a month to plan programs and activities for the school, set policies, address suggestions from parents and staff, review the budget and ensure the delivery of our mission statement.

As families graduate from ZHPP, openings on the Board become available. We are looking for both mothers and fathers who are interested in serving for the 2019-2020 school year and invite you to join us!

Please contact Liz Brown, Sara Wynkoop or Rebecca Hickey for more information or to request an application.

Thank you for voting for us as the chosen preschool in Wilton!
