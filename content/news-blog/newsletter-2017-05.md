## From the Director’s Desk:

Dear Families,

May flowers are abundant around the school as many of the classrooms started planting in the gardening boxes this month. April was a short month but packed full of excitement as always.

The Week of the Young Child is one of the most rewarding parts of the year, when we come together as a community to celebrate the children.

It was so compelling to see all of the families come out and participate in Parents and Pastries, the Parade and the Pizza Party. The spirit days that included hat, tie dye day, and kid’s choice day were a lot of fun for all. The children also participated in music, yoga and Spanish this month.

Spring Parent Conferences started and will finish this month. It is so wonderful to hear about the progress that all of the children have made during the school year.

The playgrounds are looking fantastic after the help of many families to get the toys sparkling clean and the sandboxes and mulch into shape for us all to use. We have some beautiful weather ahead of us to enjoy and the kids will love the new sand toys that are going to be waiting for them.

May will be a month full of memories.  The children will show the teachers how much they appreciate them from May 1-5. We will all get to see the baby animals from Stamford Nature Center on May 4 and 5.  Physical activity will be encouraged with Bike Day and the Mini Marathon.  The celebrations continue with our bi-annual Family Fun Day and Wilton’s Memorial Day Parade.

We are all looking forward to a memorable May!

Parents will run laps around the parking lot with the children while the staff members facilitate the race.  There will be time keepers, a water station, start and finish lines and cheerleaders.  The children will run 1 lap less than their age (2 year old – 1 lap, 5 year old – 4 laps).  This is a fun event for all to partake in as a group.  Spectators are welcome.  If you are interested in running with your child’s class, please tell your child’s teacher.

## Important Notes

### Parent-Teacher Conferences

Parent-Teacher conferences are a great opportunity for you to hear about the progress of your child. The teachers will sit with you for 15 to 30 minutes to review your child’s daily routine and show you work that he or she has created. This will also allow you time to ask any questions that you may have regarding your child’s learning. The teachers look forward to sharing the growth that they have seen in each child and highly encourage all families to participate.
