## Treat Yourself Right

Dear Families,

Happy May! Let’s hope that April showers bring May flowers—and with it some warmer temperatures, a flattening of the COVID curve or better yet a vaccine, and some return to normalcy! These are trying times. I am finding the uncertainty particularly difficult to grasp: how long will social distancing—as necessary as it is—last? When can our school/town/state/country/world safely reopen? Will summer camp proceed?

These questions weigh heavily, as many have been suddenly thrust into roles we never envisioned (home school headmaster, short order cook, closet organizer, peacekeeper, internet troubleshooter). These new roles—on top of “real” jobs and our responsibilities as mother/father/son/daughter/brother/sister/partner/friend/citizen—are requiring that we dig deep. Although these days are long and difficult, this is temporary, and you are doing enough. More than enough, you are all doing amazing! I must remind myself of this too, that keeping my family and community safe while maintaining my sanity is enough. And I must give myself permission to let some things go (like putting aside my second grader’s assignments for the day when he is simply done, giving my ninth grader more phone time to stay connected with her friends, and, as you may have gleaned from some of the videos on Google Classroom, my appearance!).

Please give yourselves permission to prioritize your family’s needs, and let some things go. This includes Google Classroom. While I encourage you to check out the wonderful content that is posted daily, please do not feel any pressure to do so or complete any activities for which you may not have the bandwidth. Again, we are all doing enough. We will eventually emerge from this, and our children will not be behind, but will have grown through this with our love and support. I know for certain that our ZHPP family will come together again and celebrate all of the wonderful learning and growth that has occurred this year.

Until then, I am extremely grateful for the partnership shared between our families and staff, and am so proud of our teachers for finding ways to continue many of the wonderful events and traditions “normally” enjoyed at ZHPP this time of year. From Week of the Young Child celebrations to conferences to an innovative take on the Mini-Marathon, our teachers have been working hard to remain connected to the children and families and provide meaningful continuation of learning. Teacher Appreciation Week could not come at a better time. THANK YOU!! And thank you for keeping your families, and our greater community, safe and healthy. Let us remain so, that we may be together again soon.

Warmly,
Jessica

## Happenings

### Spring Parent Teacher Conferences

Spring conferences will occur during May (virtually, of course)! This is a great opportunity to catch up with your child’s teachers and share in the wonderful growth that has occurred since the fall. The teachers will reach out to offer a phone call/FaceTime/Zoom meeting at a mutually convenient time, preferably when you may have a few uninterrupted moments. As much as we miss the children, conferences are still intended to be a dialogue strictly between parents and teachers. Also, in a departure from previous conferences, we will not be providing benchmarks or assessments, but only the narrative piece that has typically accompanied such forms. This will be sent to you in advance of your conference, and will serve as a launching point for discussion. If you have any questions, please contact Jessica Joy at zhppdirector@gmail.com.

### Kindergarten Information Sessions with Kathy Coon

Miller-Driscoll School Principal Kathy Coon visits ZHPP annually to speak to parents of rising kindergartners. This year’s “visits” will occur over Zoom, on Wednesday, May 13, at 3pm and Thursday, May 14, at 7pm. Please join to learn about “a day in the life of a kindergartner” and hear answers to common questions. More information will be sent to Four’s and Five’s classes.

### ZHPP “Fish Tales” Story Special with Norwalk Maritime Aquarium

Please join the Maritime Aquarium Educators on Tuesday, May 5, at either 9am or 10am for a live “Fish Tales” story time especially for ZHPP families. During the 45-minute session, the educators will read stories, sing songs, dance, and maybe even have animal guests! Each session is limited to 30 slots, so please reserve your spot using the Fish Tales google spreadsheet.
