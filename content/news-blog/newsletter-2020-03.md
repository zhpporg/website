Happy March!

Dear Families,

The third month of the year is upon us—or is it? Fun fact: the ancient Roman calendar included just ten months, beginning with March and ending with December. In many ways, March brings new beginnings as we say goodbye to winter and hello to spring. The days grow longer, the sun shines brighter, icy patches melt to muddy puddles, and plants push their way through newly thawed ground. March’s full moon is aptly called the “Worm Moon,” as a nod to all the insects that begin to hatch this month. In fact, the Stamford Museum & Nature Center visits this month to teach our students about the life cycle of local animals from beginning to end. Another fun fact: each month (all twelve!) has a uniquely named full moon. The things one can learn from preschool!

The children’s learning is certainly evident in our classrooms. It’s amazing to see their progression and development reflected in our hallways. Smiley faces have become more defined and written names appear more legible—it is undeniable that our students are gaining the skills and confidence needed to be successful learners. We are excited to open our doors to families and provide a window into the children’s learning during Read Across America/Dr. Seuss Days and Dads and Donuts. The students love showing off their school, classroom, and work with a special grownup in their life, and we, in turn, love witnessing the interactions between families and children.

The commitment you show to your children and their education is so beneficial. Your dedication means a great deal to us, too. The staff benefits directly from your generosity, as evidenced by the spectacular Valentine’s Day lunch that the Board and families provided (thank you!) and the fundraising endeavors that enable Zion’s Hill Preschool to offer our outstanding programs. We look forward to celebrating the culmination of this effort at our annual Spring Fling gala on April 24, and we thank you in advance for your support and involvement!

Until then, happy spring days ahead!

## Happenings

### Spring Fling 2020

Mark your calendars! ZHPP’s biggest social event and fundraiser of the year is Friday, April 24 at Rolling Hills Country Club. Join us for a fun-filled evening of dinner, dancing, music, and silent and live auctions. We hope to see everyone there!

We are always in need of volunteers for Spring Fling. If you’d like to decorate, solicit items for the auction, help out at the event, or contact your connections at businesses that would be willing to make a donation to the auction, that would be wonderful! Please contact Fundraising Co-Chairs Michelle Haggerty, Kelli McGee, Sarah Rhee, and Kinley Welly at fundraisingandevents@zhpp.org for more information.

### Read Across America & Dr. Seuss Days

On Monday, March 2 and Tuesday, March 3, 9am, join your child in the classroom for books and bagels! We will enjoy reading together and a light breakfast of bagels, fruit, and beverages as we celebrate Read Across America Day (and Dr. Seuss’ birthday!). Children are invited to participate in a school-wide pajama day too. More details will be provided by the classroom teachers.

### Dads and Donuts

Please join us on Saturday, March 14, anytime from 9–11am in your child’s classroom, for a tasty treat and a glimpse into the wonderful learning taking place at ZHPP. This annual, casual event is always special for children and grown-ups alike. In the past, we have welcomed many dads, but children have also brought grandparents and other important grown-ups to school on this special morning.

### Stamford Museum & Nature Center Visits

The Stamford Museum and Nature Center will visit on March 24 and 25 to present their spring program, Life Cycles. We will learn about metamorphosis and investigate insects and amphibians in various stages, from egg to adult.

## Other News

### Valentines at The Greens

Valentines were distributed and hearts were opened, as our Fearless Five’s visited The Greens at Cannondale Assisted Living Facility. The children, clad in red and pink, brought cards and necklaces that were hand-made by all the children at ZHPP, and spread them around the dining room. Scores of residents clapped, shook hands, smiled, asked questions, and shared information about themselves. After each resident had a Valentine in hand (or, more likely, a handful), the Five’s class sang songs and said loving goodbyes. One five-year-old was overhead saying to his mom, “I was a little nervous at first, but it turned out to be lots of fun!”

### Diaper Drive

During the month of March, we will collect diapers on behalf of the National Diaper Bank Network. One in three families struggle to meet children’s basic needs, and for many the cost of diapers is simply too high. The National Diaper Bank Network supplies nearly 300,000 diapers each month to babies in need. Please support this worthy organization by donating diapers of any size. Sizes 5 and 6 are particularly needed, and open packages are accepted. Look for a collection box in the lobby. Thank you for your support and generosity!

### New Families to Welcome

We are delighted to announce the enrollment of two new students: Ati Caspe joined Miss Louise and Miss Bridget’s Three’s Class, and Roger Miller began in Miss Jenny and Miss Clare’s Three’s Class. We are thrilled to welcome the Caspes and the Millers to the ZHPP family!

### Registration and Enrollment

Thank you for completing your registration forms for the 2020–2021 school year. If you have not already done so, please return the materials to the office, as spots are filling quickly. If you have any friends or neighbors considering ZHPP, please encourage them to call the office to arrange a visit. For every new family that joins ZHPP based on your recommendation, you will receive a free Extension/Afternoon Adventure to use throughout the remainder of the 2019–2020 school year! As always, we are happy to answer any questions—please see us in the office.

## Join the ZHPP Board

### Join the Board Informational Coffee

Interested in joining our Board? Let’s meet for coffee on Thursday, March 5, at 9am, in the Conference Room. The Board is comprised of parent volunteers who share their talents and give back to the school that gives our children and families so much. We meet one evening per month to plan programs and activities for the school, set policies, address suggestions from parents and staff, review the budget, and ensure the delivery of our mission statement.

The graduation of several ZHPP families has created openings on the Board. We are looking for people interested in serving for the 2020–2021 school year and invite you to join us!

Please contact Liz Brown, Sara Wynkoop, or Rebecca Hickey for more information or to request an application.

## Extended Programming

### Afternoon Adventures

Themed Afternoon Adventures occur daily from 12:30–3 for the Three’s and Four’s, and Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays for the Five’s. After a brief rest period to recharge, the children enjoy a variety of activities and outdoor time. This is a great opportunity for children in the Four’s and Five’s to begin transitioning to longer school days ahead.

* Monday: Games and Gadgets
* Tuesday: Building and Design
* Wednesday: Spanish with Señora Vicky (these small-group sessions are always popular!)
* Thursday: Kids’ Kitchen
* Friday: Fun with Fitness

Spaces are limited, so if you would like your child(ren) to participate, please sign up 24 hours in advance. Payment of $42 per session is due upon sign-up.

### Drop-in Days for Four’s

Looking to help your child build stamina for a greater number of school days? Need a day for an appointment, a meeting, or for YOU? We can help! For our Four’s currently enrolled Tuesday to Friday, students can drop in for extra learning, play, and socialization on Mondays in Miss Tracey’s class. Spaces are limited, and advanced notice is kindly requested. The cost is $50 per day, 9am–12:30pm. Please stop by the office to sign up.

## Reminders

### Sick Children

Please remember to follow the school’s illness policy provided in the family handbook. While some children appear to have the common cold, these symptoms could be indicators of the flu, strep throat, or ear infections. If your child is having persistent symptoms, please be courteous to all other children and staff members by giving the child time to rest and feel better at home. If a sibling is sick, please feel free to call the office in advance so that we can avoid exposing the school children to that sick child; we are happy to supervise your sick child in the comfort of your car while you drop off or pick up your healthy children.

### Weather-Related Delays and Cancelations

ZHPP’S policy is to follow the protocol of Wilton Public Schools with regard to weather-related delays and cancelations. If Wilton Public Schools are closed, ZHPP will be closed. If there is a one- or two-hour delay, we will begin our mornings at 10:30. If there is a three-hour delay, ZHPP will be closed. If there is an early dismissal, we will end at 12:30pm or sooner, depending on the circumstances. In all instances of early dismissal, there will be no afternoon activities.

### Pick-up and Drop-off Procedures

To ensure the safety of all, children must always be accompanied by an adult within the building. This is particularly important during drop-off and pick-up times, when our lobby and hallways can become congested.

A friendly reminder that drop-off is at 9am (doors open at 8:55), and pick-up is at 12:30pm (3pm for extended programming). Adherence to these times is appreciated, as it allows children to maximize their time in the classroom and our staff to prepare for each day.
