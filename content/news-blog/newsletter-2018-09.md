## From the Director’s Desk:

Dear Families,

Wow, that seemed like the fastest summer ever. It was so nice to see so many of our new families as well as returning families at our Summer Concert and the New Family Playdate. We are all looking forward to kicking off the school year this Wednesday with Meet the Teacher. The teachers will be on the playground from 11:00am-12:00pm to greet all of the students.

Over the summer, the teachers worked hard in their classrooms, rearranging furniture, making new displays and reconfiguring some of the overall design elements so if you have older children, the classrooms may look a bit different this year. They are also very excited about being able to communicate via Tadpoles on their new iPads in each classroom. The Three’s playground has a new sandbox and all the playgrounds have been groomed and freshly mulched.

On the first days of school, the children will be greeted in the front of the building by the Administrative team with a special opportunity to take a “First Day of Preschool” photo. This was a huge success last year and we hope it continues to be this year.

We encourage parents to spend time in the classrooms and volunteer when your schedule permits over the course of the year. Zion’s Hill Preschool Program offers an array of opportunities for social gatherings, parent interactions and most importantly, creating long lasting relationships for the children and adults alike.

I am looking forward to working with you and your child this year. It is a joy to watch children learn and grow before my eyes. Their time of being little goes so quickly, and the dedicated staff at ZHPP cherishes the chance to help shape them through our play-based curriculum.

Cheers to a successful school year!

## Extended Day Programming

### Afternoon Adventures

Our wonderful extended day programs for the Three’s, Four’s
and Five’s are designed so your child can learn, play and explore a new skill in a caring and nurturing environment. Afternoon Adventures include a short rest, focused instruction from our teachers, snack and playground time. Each program runs from 12:30–3:00pm.

Choose the day or days that appeal to your budding adventurer:

* Monday – Games and Gadgets
* Tuesday – Spanish Language
* Wednesday – Building and Design
* Thursday – Cooking with Friends
* Friday – Fun with Fitness

### Extensions for Two’s

Extended day options are available for our Two’s as well, with less emphasis on focused instruction and more time for rest and free play. Extensions also include snack and playground time, and run from 12:30–3:00pm. Extensions will start the week of September 17.

### Breakfast Club

This offering allows parents to drop off their child at 8:00am or 8:30am, before the start of our core program. All children in the Breakfast Club will meet in the same assigned classroom and enjoy quiet age-appropriate activities and a healthy breakfast provided by the school (until 8:40am). At 8:55am, the children will be escorted to their regular classrooms by a staff member.

## Important Notes

### Board of Directors

There are still a few spots remaining on the Board of Directors for the 2018-2019 academic year. We invite you to consider volunteering for a position and support the school that gives so much to our children. Please contact the Board Co-Chairs Melissa Leonard (mwalker521@gmail.com) or Heather Bravi (heather.bravi@gmail.com) with any questions.

### Enrollment

ZHPP has a few openings remaining for the 2018-19 school year. If you or someone you know are interested in enrollment, please contact the Director (zhppdirector@gmail.com) for more information.

### Tuition Payments

ZHPP does not send invoices for tuition. Please kindly remit your payment to the office on or before the due date.

### Pick-Ups

Please be sure to notify the office and your child’s teacher when someone other than you will be picking up your child. Also, please remind that person to bring a driver’s license for identification.

### Parking Lot Safety

Please use extreme caution when driving and walking in the parking lot. Hold your child’s hand. Remind your friends and family when they pick up your child to use extra caution in the parking lot. We recommend driving in the lower driveway and out the upper driveway during the busy morning drop off.

### ZHPP Is an Allergy-Aware Environment

We ask that parents be aware of the foods that they send in their children’s lunches. We do not allow peanut butter, nuts or foods containing nuts. We will send home any products that state on the label that it comes from a plant that processes nuts. In addition, we send home food that looks like it contains nuts.
