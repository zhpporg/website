## Happy Holidays

Dear Parents,

The view from our shared desk continues to be a roly, poly, smooth and exhilarating ride! So much diversity in a day, a week, the last month. Quiet times find us engaging with the kids in their classrooms, giving a tour and fine-tuning schedules. Busy times find us loading children onto a horse-drawn carriage for a hay ride, singing and dancing along with Miss Jo Anne and as always, working on communications with the staff, students and parents. We have an open door, please come to us with any questions or suggestions…Zion’s Hill is as much your school as it is ours!

Fall conferences have started and there was much hustle and bustle in preparation for the traditional 4′s Thanksgiving Feast. The school smelled amazing as children cooked muffins, stuffing and applesauce. We were delighted to be joined by local heroes this year – veterans and police officers. It was a small way for Zion’s Hill to “thank” those who serve our community. The children’s rendition of “Simple Gifts” and “The World is Good to Me” was priceless. It served as a perfect reminder of the spirit of Thanksgiving.

December will round out the first semester here at ZHPP with our wonderful specials of music, yoga, Spanish and library continuing. The children will be learning about the holidays and we invite parents and caregivers to share any special traditions or family celebrations. Of special interest, is the popular holiday sing-along with Miss Jo Anne. This will take place in the church basement on Friday, December 14 at 9:30am. All are welcome to enjoy this ZHPP tradition!

From us to you – Happy December, Happy Winter, Happy Holidays!  
Anne and Jessica

## Community Outreach

### Mitten Tree

This month we will be “decorating” a tree with hats and mittens to support Person-to-Person in Norwalk. P2P serves over 800 families a month, and during the winter provide hats, mittens and gloves to those in need. Please look for the Mitten Tree in the lobby and consider donating for this worthy organization. A thank you in advance from P2P: “We are so grateful for your kindness and support!”

### Food Drive

Wow, the “Kids Can!” Food Drive was an enormous success! The generosity of our families was incredible. ZHPP collected 346 pounds of food which will feed 288 individuals! The Soup Kitchen and Food Pantry at the Salem Lutheran Church was so appreciative. THANK YOU!

## Important Notes

### Weather-Related Delays and Cancellations

ZHPP’S policy is to follow the protocol of Wilton Public Schools with regard to weather-related delays and cancellations. If Wilton Public Schools are closed, ZHPP will be closed. If there is a delay, we will begin our mornings at 10:30am. If there is an early dismissal, we will end at 12:30pm or sooner, depending on the circumstances. In all instances of early dismissal, there will be no afternoon activities.

ZHPP uses both email and text messaging alerts in any weather related change to our schedule. If you would like to add a nanny or care-giver to our text/email chain, please let us know. There may be occasions when power/internet outages prevent us from sending emails/texts, but we make every effort to get the messages sent in a timely fashion. Please be certain to check as many sources as possible for up-to-date information and remember the general rule of thumb – we follow Wilton Public Schools!

## Parent-Teacher Conferences

The teachers have been enjoying the Fall Conferences, which began mid-November and will run through early December. It is a great opportunity to share information on your child’s day and development. Please don’t hesitate to see Anne and Jessica with any questions.

---

## Communications

We have heard from a number of parents that daily communications through Tadpoles has been a bit temperamental. We hope this has been resolved and you are receiving daily Tadpole reports and occasional communications from your classroom teacher. If this is not happening please confirm your email address with your classroom teachers and check your spam folders.

## Rest Update

Sweet dreams, everyone! While the rest portion of our day is going smoothly, the laundry from the “loaner” blankets is a challenge, and stuffed animals can be fodder for tossing games. Please feel free to send in a blanket for your child on his or her rest days, and limit stuffed animals to one. It can remain in the cubby if that makes life easier (assuming it’s a spare!). Thank you!

## Changing Weather

Please remember to dress your child for the change of seasons and upcoming winter weather. We make every effort to go outside every day and the children need the appropriate clothing to be comfortable in the conditions outside. Please try to send in clothing that your child can independently manage. Please also remember to update your child’s spare clothing with a seasonally-appropriate set.
