Come see first hand what purposeful play means at Zion’s Hill Preschool. Take a sneak peak into our classrooms. Meet our amazing teachers. Inspired by the theme of April showers, the children will listen to the story, “It Looked Like Spilt Milk,” create puffy clouds and design rain sticks. Recommended for children aged 4-5. The class is complimentary. A caregiver is required to attend. April 19, 10-11 a.m.
