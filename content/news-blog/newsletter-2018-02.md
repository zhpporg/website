## Board of Directors Update

### Join the ZHPP Board!

The board is comprised of parent volunteers who want to share their talents and give back to the school that gives our children and families so much. We meet once a month in the evening to plan programs and activities for the school, set policies, address suggestions made by parents and staff, review the budget and ensure delivery of our mission statement.

As families graduate from Zion’s Hill, openings on the board become available. We are looking for people who are interested in serving for the 2018-2019 school year and invite you to join us!

Please contact Heather Bravi (heather.bravi@gmail.com), Melissa Leonard (mwalker521@gmail.com) or Melanie Will (melaniebwill@gmail.com) for more information regarding the board or to request an application.

Please join your child February 10 from 9:30-11:00am in their classroom for a morning pastry. This casual event is a great opportunity to see what your child has been learning about and creating in class.

## Featured Family: The LaBants

New to ZHPP this year (they wish they had discovered us sooner!) and only back in town five years, Tim and Julia LaBant are Wilton natives. They met in kindergarten at Ina E. Driscoll School and graduated together from WHS. Because of their love for the town and the support system they have here – lots and lots of family! – Wilton was the obvious choice for their restaurant, The Schoolhouse at Cannondale, which will celebrate its 11th anniversary next month.

Their four kids, James (13), Anna (10), Julia (8) and Charlie (4) love to play sous chef, helping to peel vegetables and learning to put together dishes at Tim’s side. These little chefs will have ample opportunity to hone their skills with the coming of a second restaurant, Parlor, slated to open this spring in the Stop & Shop plaza, featuring neapolitan-style pizza in an open kitchen setting with a full-service bar.

Last May, Tim paired two of his passions, food and cycling, when he participated in Chefs Cycle for No Kid Hungry. Chefs Cycle is a fundraising endurance event featuring members of the culinary community riding 300 miles through Napa Valley over three days. The proceeds support No Kid Hungry, which is a movement of teachers, chefs, community leaders, parents, lawmakers and CEOs with the shared belief that no child in America should go hungry. With the support of many generous friends and family members, Tim met his goal of raising $15,000 and plans to participate in Chefs Cycle again in 2019.

Outside of work and school, the LaBants enjoy exploring the outdoors together. Warmer months are spent biking, fishing and boating on the St. Lawrence River, while winter months find them sledding, skiing and snowboarding throughout the northeast. Charlie mastered the chairlift this year – game on!

## Important Notes

### Changing Weather

We go outside every day and the children need the appropriate clothing according to the weather forecast and conditions outside. Try to send in clothing that your child can independently manage. Please also remember to update your child’s spare clothing with appropriate change of clothing in case it is needed. Layers always work well.

### Sick Children

Please remember to follow the schools illness policy provided in the parent handbook. While some children appear to have the common cold, these symptoms could be indicators of the flu, strep throat or ear infections. If your child is having persistent symptoms, please be courteous to all other children and staff members by giving them some time to rest and feel better.

### School Closings, Delays, and Dismissals

Please remember that we follow the Wilton Public School schedule for weather-related closings, delays, and early dismissals. If there is a delayed opening, ZHPP will begin at 10:30am. If there is an early dismissal, ZHPP will dismiss at 12:30pm, with no afternoon programs. We will advise of any weather-related schedule changes via text message and email.

### Parking

Please use caution in the parking lot as the weather gets colder. There may be ice patches under the snow that we can not see. Children should not be permitted to run on the sidewalk, or in the lot during the winter season. Additionally, please be courteous to the individuals who have reserved parking spaces. These include the Hickey Family and Welly Family.
