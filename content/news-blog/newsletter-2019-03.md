## Looking Forward to Spring!

Dear Families,

Happy March! This proverbial “In Like a Lion, Out Like a Lamb” month is filled with lots of changes and transformations as we say goodbye to winter and hello to spring…. the days grow longer, the sun shines brighter, icy patches melt to muddy puddles, and winter coats are replaced with lighter jackets. March is also metaphoric for the changes and transformations that the children have experienced since September… some back-to-school jitters have given way to smiles and laughter, they all have grown a little taller, expanded their vocabulary and friendships, and have their daily school routines down pat. And it’s a treat to see their progression and development in the artwork that lines our hallways, whether it be smiley faces that become more defined or a child’s written name appearing more legible, it is undeniable that they are gaining the skills needed to be successful learners! We are not wishing the school year away, but look forward to their continued growth as spring turns to summer.

This month we will continue an exploration of transformation. For the children, we welcome Woodcock Nature Center to present a program on “Spring Awakenings”. And for parents, we are holding a “Parenting is the Hardest Job in the World” workshop to help in our quest to evolve. It is not easy to navigate the tricky waters that accompany raising little human beings. But we are impressed every day by the interactions we witness between parents and children, and the commitment our families show to their child’s educational endeavors. It was lovely to see so many families at Parents and Pastries last month. Thank you for your active participation and support of Zion’s Hill, it is so beneficial to your children. And your dedication means so much to us too — the staff is often the beneficiary of your generosity, as evidenced by the spectacular Valentine’s Day lunch that the Board and families provided (thank you!), and the fundraising endeavors that enable Zion’s Hill to offer our outstanding programs. We look forward to celebrating the culmination of this effort at our annual Spring Fling gala on April 26, and thank you in advance for getting involved!

Until then, happy March, happy spring, happy days!  
Anne and Jessica

### Parent Workshop: Parenting is the Hardest Job in the World (What Works and What Doesn’t)

Wednesday March 13  
9:30am

Please join us in the conference room for a great parent workshop by Susan O’Brien.

“When our children push our buttons our skills go out the window and we may respond in ineffective ways. This workshop will teach strategies so you can discipline your child even when you are stressed. You will learn how to recognize when you are stressed and develop techniques to react appropriately in the face of your child pushing your buttons. You will learn how to manage every day parenting challenges by approaching these challenges in a calm and positive manner.”

## Fundraising

### Spring Fling

Friday, April 26  
Rolling Hills Country Club, Wilton

Mark your calendars! Zion’s Hill’s biggest social event and fundraiser of the year is Friday, April 26 at Rolling Hills Country Club! Join us for a fun-filled evening of dinner, dancing, music, and silent and live auctions. We hope to see everyone there!

We are always in need of volunteers for Spring Fling. If you’d like to decorate, solicit items for the auction, help that night — or if you have connections with businesses that would be willing to make a donation to the auction, that would be wonderful! Please contact Melissa Leonard (mwalker521@gmail.com) or Heather Bravi (heather.bravi@gmail.com) for more information.

### Thank Yous

A big thank you to everyone who participated in the Valentine’s Day Luncheon! The teachers all really appreciated the thoughtful lunches, small gifts and festive decorations!

The “Will You Be a Valentine” project was a HUGE success! We collected over 100 valentines in the beautiful “Love Box” built by Wednesday Afternoon’s Building and Design team for residents at The Greens of Cannondale/Wilton Meadows. Miss Jessica delivered the box to The Greens with two of her own kiddos (ZHPP alumni!), and witnessed firsthand the happiness it brought to the residents. They were truly so appreciative and touched, and it proved to be a heart-warming experience for Miss Jessica’s children too. We will do this again in the Spring, and welcome any interested families to help deliver and spread some cheer. Here is a summary of the Joy boys’ experience:

“Hey everybody, Liam Joy here and I just wanted to let you know about how the delivery went. The Greens is a great facility with great people running it. When we got there, they had just begun serving dinner, so we went from table to table handing them out. The residents were so excited when we handed them out, we thought some of them were going to cry tears of joy. They were all so thankful that we had come and said hi that some of them wanted us to do it again. I had a great time talking and meeting the people staying at the Greens and when we exited the building, Bryce said how the ‘Greens was a great place.’ I was so surprised in hearing this because when we had first gone in he was acting very shy, not wanting to hand out any valentines. Doing this not only made me feel good, it acted as my community service act for the month and that means a lot to me. Thanks again for making people’s day.” —Liam Joy, age 10

“I hope everybody is doing well. Me and Liam and my mom passed out valentines at the Greens. Some people almost cried because they were very happy. When I left, I said ‘The Greens is a beautiful place.’” —Bryce Joy, age 7

### Summer Camp

Believe it or not, it’s time to start planning for Summer! We are busy preparing a “Fun by Land, Sea, and Air!” themed Summer Camp. Camp days run from 9:00am-12:30pm and include free play, music, stories, arts and crafts, snack, time for lunch, and of course plenty of outdoor time with water tables, sprinklers, bubbles and outdoor art activities. Each week will also feature a special program from a local organization:

* June 10-14: “Dinosaur Discovery” with Stamford Museum and Nature Center
* June 17-21: “Space Frontiers” with Mad Science
* June-24-28: “Meet the Animals” with Maritime Aquarium

Sign up for one or all three weeks! Please return the registration form to the office as soon as possible as space is limited, and let us know if you have any questions. We hope to see many happy campers this Summer!
Join the ZHPP Board

The Board is comprised of parent volunteers who share their talents and give back to the school that gives our children and families so much. We meet one evening a month to plan programs and activities for the school, set policies, address suggestions from parents and staff, review the budget and ensure the delivery of our mission statement.

As families graduate from ZHPP, openings on the Board become available. We are looking for people who are interested in serving for the 2019-2020 school year and invite you to join us!

Please contact Heather Bravi (heather.bravi@gmail.com), Melissa Leonard (mwalker521@gmail.com) or Rebecca Hickey (rhickey1221@gmail.com) for more information or to request an application.

## Important Notes

### Parking Lot

As there may still be some wintry days ahead, please be extra cautious in the parking lot. Although the plow does a pretty good job of getting the snow out of the way, icy patches can exist. Children should be with a responsible adult at all times and should not be running in the parking lot. Also, unless you have made arrangements to drop off your child with a staff member at the front door, please do not park along the curb. There is ample parking for everyone!

### Weather Related Delays and Cancellations

As a reminder, ZHPP’S policy is to follow the protocol of Wilton Public Schools with regard to weather-related delays and cancellations. If Wilton Public Schools are closed, ZHPP will be closed. If there is a one or a two-hour delay, we will begin our mornings at 10:30am. If there is a three-hour delay, ZHPP will be closed. If there is an early dismissal, we will end at 12:30pm or sooner, depending on the circumstances. In all instances of early dismissal, there will be no afternoon activities.

ZHPP uses both email and text messaging alerts in any weather related change to our schedule. If you would like to add a nanny or care-giver to our text/email chain, please let us know. There may be occasions when power/internet outages prevent us from sending emails/texts, but we make every effort to get the messages sent in a timely fashion. Please be certain to check as many sources as possible for up-to-date information and remember the general rule of thumb – we follow Wilton Public Schools!

### Extended-Day Adventures

Join us for extended learning until 3:00pm! Themed Afternoon Adventures occur daily from 12:30-3:00pm for the 3′s and 4′s. After a brief rest period to regroup, the children do a variety of activities and enjoy additional outdoor time. This is a great opportunity for children in the 4′s program to begin transitioning to longer school days ahead!

* Monday: Games and Gadgets
* Tuesday: Spanish with Señora Vicky (these small group sessions are always popular!)
* Wednesday: Building and Design
* Thursday: Cooking with Friends
* Friday: Fun with Fitness

### Drop-in Days for 3′s and 4′s

Looking to help your child build stamina for a greater number of school days? Need a day for an appointment, a meeting, or for YOU? We can help!

ZHPP is now offering a Monday drop-in for our 4’s students, and a Tuesday/Thursday drop-in for our 3′s! For our 4′s currently enrolled Tuesday to Friday, students can drop-in for extra learning, play, and socialization on Mondays in Miss Marissa’s class. And for our 3′s, students can spend Tuesday and/or Thursday mornings with Miss Tracey. Spaces are limited, and advanced notice is kindly requested. The cost is $50 per day, 9:00am-12:30pm.
