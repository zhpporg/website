Dear Parents,

We hope this finds you well-satiated with food, drink, family and friends. January is a great time to hit the reset button – earlier bed times, house decluttering, and of course the infamous New Year’s resolutions to reverse holiday indulgences. It can be both motivating and invigorating to step outside our comfort zones and try something different; better yet, to encourage others along the way … Our talented teachers are proof positive of this as they gently guide the children along their learning journey. And the thrill on the little ones’ faces when they master a skill — whether it be building a block tower, completing a puzzle, or spelling their name — teaches us that perseverance pays off. There is power in numbers; the children discover something new each day, and we can follow their lead.

While we grown-ups may see the New Year as an opportunity to test old habits, the children will be settling into the safe comfort of school routines. January will find us enjoying music, yoga, Spanish and library, in addition to daily classroom activities. And we feel confident in saying the children are probably more than ready for snow!

Though the calendar year has just begun, preparations for the next school year are well underway and registration officially begins January 7. We are excited to see all of your children “graduate” to the next class — some to kindergarten! — and to welcome a new group of students that will become part of the ZHPP family. To that end, we are holding an Open House on Saturday, January 5, for prospective families. Please continue to invite friends and neighbors to explore our wonderful school. We consistently hear during tours that “my neighbor/cousin/friend’s child is at ZHPP and they are so happy!” Thank you!

Here’s to a great year ahead. Set goals, lean on friends and enjoy the challenge, whatever it may be!

Cheers,  
Anne and Jessica

## Special Events

On Monday, February 11 we will honor our staff with a Valentine’s Day luncheon. Volunteers prepare or buy a complete lunch (i.e., sandwich/soup/salad, dessert, and a drink) and include something special. In the past, volunteers have included a magazine, lottery ticket, or some other small token of appreciation.
Lunches are brought to school at pick up on February 11. If you would like to contribute to this special day, please email Clare Passaro at cepassaro@gmail.com.

## Community Outreach

### Cold Feet, Warm Hearts

During the month of January, we will be collecting socks for the Open Door Shelter in Norwalk. The Open Door provides nightly shelter with over 95 beds at their facility. They also serve over 20,000 meals per month at the Mann House kitchen and pantry. Socks are the most requested, but least donated, articles of clothing in homeless shelters.

New socks of all sizes are appreciated, but adult crew socks are most needed. Look for the Sock Monkey in the lobby and help us warm some toes!

### Mitten Tree

Thank you for beautifully “decorating” the mitten tree during December!

We collected nearly 50 pairs of gloves, mittens and hats to support Person-to-Person in Norwalk. P2P serves over 800 families a month, and during the winter provide hats, mittens and gloves to those in need.

A note from P2P: “We are so grateful for your kindness and support!”

## Important Notes

### Parking Lot

As the weather gets colder, please be extra cautious in the parking lot. Although the plow does a pretty good job of getting the snow out of the way, icy patches can exist. Children should be with a responsible adult at all times and should not be running in the parking lot. Also, unless you have made arrangements to drop off your child with a staff member at the front door, please do not park along the curb. There is ample parking for everyone!

### Communications

We have heard from a number of parents that daily communications through Tadpoles has been a bit temperamental. We hope this has been resolved and you are receiving daily Tadpole reports and occasional communications from your classroom teacher. If this is not happening please confirm your email address with your classroom teachers and check your spam folders.

### Rest Update

Sweet dreams, everyone! While the rest portion of our day is going smoothly, the laundry from the “loaner” blankets is a challenge, and stuffed animals can be fodder for tossing games. Please feel free to send in a blanket for your child on his or her rest days, and limit stuffed animals to one. It can remain in the cubby if that makes life easier (assuming it’s a spare!). Thank you!
