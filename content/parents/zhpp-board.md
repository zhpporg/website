## Welcome letter

On behalf of the Board of Directors, welcome to Zion’s Hill Preschool Program!
The board is a group of dedicated parent volunteers who use their skills, talents, and experience to make Zion’s Hill the best preschool that it can be. Parents join the Board for various reasons – to be more involved in the school’s community, to better understand their child’s pre-school education, to give back to the school for all it does for their kids, etc. We meet monthly to plan programs and activities for the school, set policies, address concerns and suggestions from parents and staff, review the budget, and ensure delivery of our mission statement.

Although this year will look quite different from years past, the board’s aim to represent the interests of the entire school community – children, families, and staff – will remain the same. We welcome your feedback and encourage you to share your ideas with the board throughout the year.

Sincerely,

Gina Chute and Sarah Rhee
Co-Chairwomen 2020–2021
