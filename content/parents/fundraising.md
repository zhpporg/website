## Annual Spring Fling Fundraiser

Friday April 24, 2020

The fundraising committee of Zion’s Hill Preschool Program (ZHPP) is in the process of planning our annual Spring Fling fundraiser, which will include both a live and silent auction.  This event has been extremely successful thanks to the continued support and generosity from members of our community like you. All proceeds from this year’s auction will help to improve our classrooms by donating items that the teachers have identified as a need for their classes.

Voted “Wilton’s Best Preschool in 2018,” ZHPP is a preschool for children ages two through five years. Our program began in 1972, priding itself on a safe, nurturing environment that encourages children’s social, physical and intellectual development through a play-based philosophy.

We hope you will consider donating an item, a service or a gift certificate to our auction. If you choose to participate, your donation will be auctioned during the evening of our fundraiser, on Friday, April 24th. Prior to the event, an auction booklet describing items and naming the contributors will be distributed electronically to approximately 100 families that attend our school.  And you will be acknowledged in our monthly newsletter as well. These are wonderful ways to generate some positive publicity in the community.

Zion’s Hill Preschool Program for children ages 2-5 years has been a part of Wilton since 1972 and is known for its warm, nurturing staff, play-based curriculum, and amazing sense of community. While the Administration and Board of Directors make every effort to stretch each tuition dollar, tuition simply does not cover all the cost of the school’s daily operations. As a nonprofit organization, ZHPP relies on the generosity of its families and community to maintain its outstanding curriculum and make needed improvements to facilities and classroom supplies. ZHPP strives to keep its tuition affordable and offers financial aid when needed, thereby allowing the school to welcome as many local families as possible.

*Thank you in advance for your generosity and commitment to ZHPP, and for supporting our children, teachers, and future.*

## Annual Appeal

Zion’s Hill Preschool Program is known for its warm, nurturing staff, play-based curriculum, and amazing sense of community. While the Administration and Board of Directors make every effort to stretch each tuition dollar, tuition simply does not cover the cost of the school’s daily operations. As a nonprofit organization, ZHPP relies on the generosity of its families to maintain its outstanding curriculum through the Annual Appeal.

ZHPP’s daily operations budget might not sound very exciting, but it encompasses so much of what makes the school a special place for our children.  Employee salaries support our amazing and talented teachers and staff.  Rent pays for the school’s building and grounds that house our activity-filled classrooms, library, movement room, and playgrounds. Enrichment Programs such as Spanish with Señora Vicky, yoga and music with Miss JoAnne, and Masterpiece with Miss Christine make school days extra special. All of these things would not be possible without funds from the Annual Appeal.

The Annual Appeal enables ZHPP to keep its tuition affordable, thereby allowing the school to welcome as many local families as possible. **Thank you to all of our families. We had very high school wide participation in this year’s Annual Appeal and appreciate your support.**
