Part of what makes the community here at Zion’s Hill Preschool Program so special and unique are the families, local businesses, and groups volunteering their time and various services.

These contributions help create the foundation of what our program is all about. They illustrate the generosity present here at Zion’s Hill Preschool Program.

We would like to take a moment to extend a warm “thank you” to you.

We are grateful for each of your generous contributions throughout the school year here at ZHPP.
