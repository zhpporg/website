## Afternoon Adventures

*Choose the day or days that appeal to your budding adventurer.*

Afternoon Adventures, our wonderful extended day programs for the Three’s, Four’s, and Five’s, are designed so your child can learn, play, and explore.

The teachers plan theme-based activities for the children to delve into for the extended afternoon.

Afternoon Adventures include theme-focused activities, snack, and playground time.

The program runs from 12:30 to 3:00 pm each weekday for Three’s and Four’s, and from 12:30 to 3:00 pm on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays for Five’s.

### Monday – Games and Gadgets

This adventure includes math and science games, books, puzzles, activities, observations, and experiments. Special focus is on visuals and the use of science and math vocabulary.

### Tuesday - Building and Design

This adventure uses a wide range of materials to build, shap,e and form new projects. Watch your child’s imagination soar!

### Wednesday – Spanish Language

This adventure incorporates songs, music, movement, stories, and games to teach key Spanish phrases and vocabulary. Learning Spanish is fun for your preschooler—the prime age for language acquisition.

### Thursday – Kids’ Kitchen

This adventure allows children to participate in the creation and enjoyment of making food and eating it. They will learn measuring, preparation, and perhaps even try new foods! Kitchen safety is also emphasized.

### Friday – Fun with Fitness

This adventure further develops your child’s gross-motor skills and utilizes our enhanced Movement Room, where basketball, barre, tumbling, and climbing abounds. Games to practice skills and expend energy are emphasized.

## Drop-In Availability

Afternoon Adventures are offered on a contract basis for the year or whenever they may suit your schedule. Drop-ins are welcome based on availability and should be made 24 hours in advance. Charges for drop-ins are due on the day they are used and must be paid at drop-off time.

## Extensions

Extended days options are available for our Two’s as well, without a focus on instruction. This allows for more rest time and free play. It also includes a snack and playground time and runs from 12:30–3 pm.
