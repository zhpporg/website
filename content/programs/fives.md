Zion’s Hill has a program for five-year-olds specifically designed to foster independence and social development, while promoting higher learning within the classroom.

The program’s unique curriculum allows teachers to design a plan for each child based on individual strengths, challenges, and interests.

* Special attention is paid to social and emotional learning, cognitive development, and the fine- and gross-motor skills needed for kindergarten.
* Children explore creative expression through several art forms and music, and take part in frequent field trips throughout the year.
* Healthy snack, time for lunch, and outdoor play are included each day.
