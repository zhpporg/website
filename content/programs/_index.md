Through the guidance of highly qualified teachers with degrees in early-childhood education and development, children have the opportunity to creatively explore their environment, as well as develop a strong sense of self-esteem.

Using the theories and research of Montessori, Reggio Emilia, Vygotsky, Erikson, Piaget, and the National Association for the Education of Young Children ([NAEYC](http://www.naeyc.org/)), our teachers create an environment where children have many choices and opportunities for creating, communicating, and discovering while allowing them to learn both in groups and individually

Our teachers’ goals include engaging, mediating, and facilitating through creative art and structural projects, music and songs, reading and story-telling, sensory and motor activities, and plenty of time to play.

Lessons, evaluations, and assessments are based on CT benchmark goals.

Our [strong curriculum]({{< ref "/programs/curriculum" >}}) disguised as playful fun results in a solid foundation for kindergarten readiness.
