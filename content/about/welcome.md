Welcome to Zion’s Hill Preschool Program. It is an honor to be the Director of this beloved school, the very school that my own children attended and was our “home” for so many years. I am thrilled to now be part of your family’s journey through Zion’s Hill. We are a true community of teachers, parents, grandparents, and caregivers uniting to provide a nurturing and unique preschool experience. Children (and families!) leave our school with lasting friendships and the skills to be lifelong learners.

Zion’s Hill is entering its 47th year of providing an outstanding early childhood education program. The school’s longevity and success is a direct result of the strong commitment of our parent-run Board of Directors, the dedication and warmth of our talented teachers, an amazing support staff, and most importantly the children, who fill our halls and hearts with joy.

We invite you to visit our classrooms and participate in the activities that ZHPP offers throughout the year. These special events not only highlight the distinct characteristics of our program, but also help build and support our unique community.

With warmest thanks,

Jessica Joy, Director
