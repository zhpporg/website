Our team of highly skilled educators facilitates play-based learning through thematic activities, drawing upon the Creative Curriculum and the CT Preschool Curriculum Framework.

Play-based learning offers children a natural environment to build the foundations for reading, writing, math, and science, while simultaneously practicing the social and emotional tools necessary to foster friendships, independence, and self-help skills. These skills, coupled with gross-motor activities and creative arts, allow children to grow through exploration, discovery, and expression.

Our low teacher-to-student ratio enables us to focus on each child and their unique potential, which in turn allows children to develop self-confidence and a lifelong love of learning. In partnership with families and the community, we provide a nurturing and loving atmosphere to support our children and provide continuity between school and home.
