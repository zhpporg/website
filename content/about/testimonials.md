We found ZHPP during a time of need. We'd just moved to Wilton, and while our son's birthdate qualified him for kindergarten, he needed more time to build skills, confidence, and socialization. Enter ZHPP! We enrolled him in the 5's class and it was the best decision we could have made. Our son is now a thriving first grader. ZHPP is an amazing community, devoted to each and every child. We are so grateful!

We have been lucky enough to send all three of our boys to preschool at Zion's Hill. Not only have they made lifelong friends, but ZHPP's play based curriculum gave them all the skills they needed to excel in kindergarten and beyond.

Words can't express how happy we have been with the Zion's Hill Preschool Program 5's class. Our youngest has a late fall birthday and we knew we wanted to give him that extra time before entering Kindergarten. Zion's Hill has been exactly what he needed.<br>

The class ratio of two full-time amazing teachers for 12 children allows each child to have individual attention.The teachers are able to fully embrace the play-based learning philosophy of ZHPP while at the same time really working with each child to help prepare him or her for Kindergarten - working on reading, writing, and math skills.<br>

He is gaining so much from the various learning centers, play time, community building, and opportunities for developing independence and responsibility that are critical to young children.Every day my son is excited to go to school and at least once a week he tells me that he has the best teachers in the world. This will be his last preschool experience and to have him this happy, growing and thriving academically and socially is all that a parent can ask for. He will remember his time at ZHPP fondly and it is a year that my husband and I will treasure for him.

Having had two years of extraordinary experience with ZHPP, teaching our son, we wanted to put into words as best we could, the reasons for our satisfaction with the school.Wilton is a fortunate place to be parents. Having raised two previous children while living in town, we were very familiar with the abundance of options available for preschoolers in the area. So, after adopting a little boy from Ethiopia in 2009, and being faced with list of concerns unique to our experience, we were very glad to be presented with so many choices.<br>

We needed to find a school that balanced the educational catch-up that we suspected was necessary, with the challenges of socializing a little boy who found himself in a radically different environment from which he was familiar. After investigating many schools, we found Zion's Hill and for two years have been delighted with the results.Zion's Hill staff is wonderful. While clearly being the professional educators we were looking for, they have proven to be the warm, inclusive, loving people that our little boy needed. The school has provided a second environment where he feels completely accepted and at ease. His development has been inspiring… he is thriving in a group of exceptional children; happy, playful, and eager to learn.The school has been remarkable in helping us guide our son as he negotiates what it means to be an adopted child from a country so different from the U.S.<br>

It is not just the respect for differences that has impressed us, but the carefully planned use of differences as learning tools. By teaching that both differences and similarities are strengths, a difficult process has been eased. In three years, our little boy has advanced to where we had five years to bring our other children: ready to enter the challenging Wilton school system. We are confident that he is ready, and excited to watch him continue to grow.<br>

We will forever be thankful for having had the opportunity of placing our child in the care of ZHPP.

Our oldest son’s year in the 3’s program with Miss Louise and Miss Jenny was one of such growth and wonder, we couldn’t imagine finding a more nurturing environment anywhere. We can’t wait for our younger child to experience their special brand of fun and play-based learning next year when he moves up from the 2’s.
