## Four's and Floater

![](/about/meet-our-staff/kathy-drabaski-150x150.jpeg)

Kathy joined ZHPP in 2000, bringing 24 years of previous early childhood experience. She holds a BS in Early Childhood Education from Central Connecticut State University and has participated in NAEYC conferences as well as the Yale Early Childhood Study. She enjoys sharing with students her love of animals, nature, and being outdoors. Kathy relishes the “ah-ha” moment, when a child figures something out, solves a problem, or learns a new skill. She lives in Fairfield with her husband, David, and enjoys time with her large extended family.

Favorite childhood book: *The Velveteen Rabbit*, “because of the passage about becoming ‘real’ when you are loved.”
