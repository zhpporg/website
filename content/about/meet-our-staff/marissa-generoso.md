With more than 25 years of experience teaching children ages two through six, Marissa joined Zion’s Hill Preschool in 2016. She holds an AD in Early Childhood Education from Norwalk Community College. Marissa focuses on each child’s strengths to help them feel confident and comfortable in achieving their goals, and she relishes children’s lit-up faces when they do! Marissa’s home in Norwalk is full: husband Carl, children Dax, Mia, and Tanner, and five dogs.

Favorite children’s book: *Lilly and the Purple Plastic Purse*. “I like this book because it teaches children about emotions, feelings, and thoughts. We need to show children to be kind and respectful, to admit when they are wrong, and to learn how to fix a situation when it is not a positive one.”
