Anne joined ZHPP as a parent before becoming a staff member in 2001. She earned her BA in Dance from SUNY and MA in Early Childhood from Adelphi University. Her sheer love of being with kids compelled her to become a teacher. Anne loves walking, running, and spinning, and lives in Wilton with her husband, Fred, and their four daughters, Phoebe, Zoe, Keiley, and Sophie. A dog, two cats, and two frogs complete Anne’s big family!

Favorite children’s book: *Stuart Little*. “I love mice!”
