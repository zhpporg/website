Sally is originally from Michigan and has a BS in Finance from Boston College and an MBA from Fordham University. In 2014, she joined Zion’s Hill Preschool, where she loves to help children grow and expand their knowledge in partnership with their families. Reading, gardening, and walking are some of her favorite activities. She lives in Wilton with her husband, Thom, and their children, Sarah, Elizabeth, and Nancy.

Favorite children’s book: *Madeline*. “I love the rhyming and Madeline’s antics. I can remember my father reading it to me.”
