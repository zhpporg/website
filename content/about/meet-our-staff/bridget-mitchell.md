Bridget holds an AS degree in Early Childhood Education from Empire State College. She also has a strong background in theater, with a degree from Lee Strasberg Theater Institute. She started teaching at Zion’s Hill Preschool in 2015. In the classroom, she loves watching the children grow throughout the year, form friendships, become independent, and take in the world around them. Swimming, letter boxing, and photography keep her busy outside of school. Originally from Winnipeg, Canada, Bridget now lives in Wilton with her son, Lachlan.

Favorite children’s book: *Are You My Mother?* “When my mom read it to me, she made a giant snort sound, which I thought was so funny.”
