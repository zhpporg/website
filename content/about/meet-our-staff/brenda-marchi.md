Brenda holds a BA in Psychology from St. Michael’s College. She joined the ZHPP family in 2004, where she has worked with all age groups and now serves as Assistant Director. Brenda loves bowling and Scrabble and watching the ZHPP students discover new things about life and themselves. She lives in Wilton with her family: Justin, Elizabeth, John, and Benjamin.

Favorite children’s book: *The Giving Tree*. “I love the book, though I didn’t read it until college. My roommate gave it to me!’
