Meg came to Zion’s Hill Preschool as a parent before becoming a regular sub and then a staff member in 2017. Meg has a BA in Economics from the University of Connecticut. She also spent many years as an Emergency Medical Technician for the FDNY and brings expertise in first aid and conflict resolution to the school. Providing a safe and positive learning environment is critical to Meg’s teaching philosophy. She thoroughly enjoys the excited faces of students as they engage in new activities. Meg lives in Wilton with her husband, Steve, and their children, Morgan and Liam.

Favorite childhood book: *The Sneetches*. “Dr. Seuss illustrates a fundamental truth in such a creative way, reminding us that we are all the same on the inside.”
