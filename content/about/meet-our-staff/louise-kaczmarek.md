Louise started at ZHPP as a floater in 2005, progressed to an assistant teacher position, and became lead teacher in the Three’s in 2013. Louise loves nothing more than opening young minds to the wonders of the world and showing children the fun in learning. She is a graduate of McGill University in Montreal and lives in Weston with her husband, Tom, her children, Evie, Adele, and John, and her dog, Sydney. When Louise is not teaching she enjoys doing genealogical research for family and friends.

Favorite children’s book: *The Lion and the Little Red Bird* by Elisa Kleven. “A beautiful story about two strangers who find understanding and friendship through art.”
