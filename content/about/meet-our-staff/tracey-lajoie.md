Tracey joined Zion’s Hill Preschool in 2016, bringing with her 29 years of early childhood education experience. She previously taught three- and four-year-olds at a private school in Stamford. She has a BA in Psychology/Child Development from Quinnipiac College. Tracey’s teaching motto is, “Together we may give our children the roots to grow and the wings to fly.” Teaching is an adventure for Tracey. She loves the students’ smiles, curiosity, amazement, learning, and wonder. She lives in Norwalk, where she reads, bakes, practices yoga, walks, and shops. Tracey’s husband, Mark, three sons, Zackary, Aiden, and Travis, three dogs, and two cats fill her household.

Favorite children’s book: *Winnie the Pooh*. “It was always my mother’s favorite, so she read it to me all the time. I love how all the different animals are friends, and they always go on new adventures together.”
