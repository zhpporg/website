## Floater

After three years as a parent, Liz joined the Zion’s Hill Preschool faculty in 2019. She holds a degree in sociology and criminal justice from Mount Saint Mary’s University. Liz is drawn to teaching because of “the happiness and wonder in children and the joy in watching them learn something new.” She lives in Darien with her husband, Drew, and children, Grady, Sean, and Kelly.

Favorite children’s book: *Where the Wild Things Are*. “I love how it allows kids the freedom to use their imaginations.”
