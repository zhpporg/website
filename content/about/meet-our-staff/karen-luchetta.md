Karen joined the ZHPP staff in 2016. She graduated from the University of Rhode Island where she earned a BS in Fashion Merchandising and Design. Teaching is a rewarding experience for Karen. She loves contributing to the learning and growing that her students do every day. Karen lives in Wilton with family: Kevin, Riley, Ryan, and dog, Rascal.

Favorite children’s book: *The Little Engine That Could*. “This book shows kids that they should never give up, even if they’re small.”
