![](/about/meet-our-staff/jenny-blumenfeld-150x150.jpeg)

Before joining ZHPP in 2014, Jenny taught kindergarten in Rye, New York, for 13 years. She holds a BA in business management and an MA in elementary education. She loves teaching the Three’s, where she instills in her students confidence and joy. Jenny is an avid baker and lives in Weston with her husband, Scott, and three children, Katie, Kyle, and Ethan.

Favorite childhood book: *Brown Bear, Brown Bear*. “This book elicits so many teaching opportunities, while being fun and entertaining for young children.”
