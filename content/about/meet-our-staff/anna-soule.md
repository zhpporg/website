Anna joined the Zion’s Hill Preschool faculty in 2007. Before that, she was an active parent with two children attending the program. Anna holds an AS in Early Childhood Education. She loves working with the two-year-olds because of their curiosity, eagerness to learn, and growth into capable human beings. Anna loves running, reading, cooking, and her dog. She grew up in Sweden and now lives in Wilton with her husband, Larry, and children, Victoria and Christopher.

Favorite children’s book: *Anything* by Astrid Lindgren. “I grew up in Sweden, and Astrid Lindgren is my favorite children’s author there.”
