With a degree in psychology from Mount Holyoke College, Sarah joined the ZHPP family in 2007. She has years of experience raising her three children and volunteering in the community. Sarah loves to observe her students’ enthusiasm and joy for life. She enjoys exercising, gardening, and hand crafts such as sewing and rug-hooking. Sarah lived in Ridgefield with her husband, Paul, and children, Sam, Elizabeth, and Margaret.

Favorite children’s book: *The Poky Little Puppy*. “The puppy’s curiosity for nature pulled me in and, for some reason, I enjoy his naughty little personality.”
